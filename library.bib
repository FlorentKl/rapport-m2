abstract = {Adult neurogenesis is the process by which new neurons are generated in the brains of adults. Since its discovery 50 years ago, adult neurogenesis has been widely studied in the mammalian brain and has provided a new perspective on the pathophysiology of many psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, some of which affect memory. In this regard, adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), which occurs in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), has been suggested to play a role in the formation and consolidation of new memories. This process involves many transcription factors, of which cyclic AMP (cAMP)-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) is a well-documented one. In the developing brain, CREB regulates crucial cell stages (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, and survival), and in the adult brain, it participates in neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. In addition, new evidence supports the hypothesis that CREB may also participate in learning and memory through its involvement in AHN. This review examines the CREB family of transcription factors, including the different members and known signaling pathways. It highlights the role of CREB as a modulator of AHN, which could underlie its function in memory consolidation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Patterning centers that produce gradients of morphogenetic molecules, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), Wnt, Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and retinoic acid (RA), are located in telencephalic anlage during early stages of development. Genetic evidence based on loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies indicate that they are involved in regional specification of the dorsal, ventral, and lateral telencephalon. For patterning of the dorsal telencephalon, FGF8 controls the anteroposterior patterning, while BMP and Wnt molecules regulate the mediolateral patterning. Shh and retinoic acid regulate patterning of the ventral and the lateral telencephalon. The regionalization of telencephalon is accompanied by expression of region-specific codes of transcription factors, which in turn regulate different phases of neuronal development to generate different cell types in each brain region. Therefore, bioactive signals of morphogenetic molecules are translated into transcription factor codes for regional specification, which subsequently leads to neurogenesis of the diversity of cell types in different regions of the telencephalon.},

abstract = {The neuromuscular synapse is a relatively large synapse with hundreds of active zones in presynaptic motor nerve terminals and more than ten million acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the postsynaptic membrane. The enrichment of proteins in presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes ensures a rapid, robust, and reliable synaptic transmission. Over fifty years ago, classic studies of the neuromuscular synapse led to a comprehensive understanding of how a synapse looks and works, but these landmark studies did not reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for building and maintaining a synapse. During the past two-dozen years, the critical molecular players, responsible for assembling the specialized postsynaptic membrane and regulating nerve terminal differentiation, have begun to be identified and their mechanism of action better understood. Here, we describe and discuss five of these key molecular players, paying heed to their discovery as well as describing their currently understood mechanisms of action. In addition, we discuss the important gaps that remain to better understand how these proteins act to control synaptic differentiation and maintenance.},

abstract = {Neural precursor cells (NPCs) have the ability to self-renew and to give rise to neuronal and glial lineages. The fate decision of NPCs between proliferation and differentiation determines the number of differentiated cells and the size of each region of the brain. However, the signals that regulate the timing of neuronal differentiation remain unclear. Here, we show that Wnt signaling inhibits the self-renewal capacity of mouse cortical NPCs, and instructively promotes their neuronal differentiation. Overexpression of Wnt7a or of a stabilized form of beta-catenin in mouse cortical NPC cultures induced neuronal differentiation even in the presence of Fgf2, a self-renewal-promoting factor in this system. Moreover, blockade of Wnt signaling led to inhibition of neuronal differentiation of cortical NPCs in vitro and in the developing mouse neocortex. Furthermore, the beta-catenin/TCF complex appears to directly regulate the promoter of neurogenin 1, a gene implicated in cortical neuronal differentiation. Importantly, stabilized beta-catenin did not induce neuronal differentiation of cortical NPCs at earlier developmental stages, consistent with previous reports indicating self-renewal-promoting functions of Wnts in early NPCs. These findings may reveal broader and stage-specific physiological roles of Wnt signaling during neural development.},

abstract = {Dendritic spines are tiny membranous protrusions from neuron's dendrites. They play a very important role in the nervous system. A number of mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and mental retardation are revealed to have close relations with spine morphologies or spine number changes. Spines have various shapes, and spine images are often not of good quality; hence it is very challenging to detect spines in neuron images. This paper presents a novel pipeline to detect dendritic spines in 2D maximum intensity projection (MIP) images and a new dendrite backbone extraction method is developed in the pipeline. The strategy for the backbone extraction approach is that it iteratively refines the extraction result based on directional morphological filtering and improved Hessian filtering until a satisfactory extraction result is obtained. A shortest path method is applied along a backbone to extract the boundary of the dendrites. Spines are then segmented from the dendrites outside the extracted boundary. Touching spines will be split using a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. We present the results of our algorithm on real images and compare our algorithm with two other spine detection methods. The results show that the proposed approach can detect dendrites and spines more accurately. Measurements and classification of spines are also made in this paper.},

abstract = {Wnts are small secreted glycoproteins that are highly conserved among species. To date, 19 Wnts have been described, which initiate a signal transduction cascade that is either beta-catenin dependent or independent, culminating in the regulation of hundreds of target genes. Extracellular release of Wnts is dependent on lipidation of Wnts by porcupine, a membrane-bound-O-acyltransferase protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Studies demonstrating the requirement of porcupine for Wnts production are based on cell line and non-human primary cells. We evaluated the requirement for porcupine for Wnts production in human primary astrocytes and CD8+ T cells. Using IWP-2, an inhibitor of porcupine, or siRNA targeting porcupine, we demonstrate that porcupine is not required for the release of Wnt 1, 3, 5b, 6,7a, 10b, and 16a. While IWP had no effect on Wnt 2b release, knockdown of porcupine by siRNA reduced Wnt 2b release by 60{\%}. These data indicate that porcupine-mediated production of Wnts is context dependent and is not required for all Wnts production, suggesting that alternative mechanisms exist for Wnts production.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hedgehog (Hh) signals are instrumental to the dorsoventral patterning of the vertebrate eye, promoting optic stalk and ventral retinal fates and repressing dorsal retinal identity. There has been limited analysis, however, of the critical window during which Hh molecules control eye polarity and of the temporal changes in the responsiveness of eye cells to these signals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this study, we used pharmacological and molecular tools to perform stage-specific manipulations of Hh signalling in the developing Xenopus eye. In gain-of-function experiments, most of the eye was sensitive to ventralization when the Hh pathway was activated starting from gastrula/neurula stages. During optic vesicle stages, the dorsal eye became resistant to Hh-dependent ventralization, but this pathway could partially upregulate optic stalk markers within the retina. In loss-of-function assays, inhibition of Hh signalling starting from neurula stages caused expansion of the dorsal retina at the expense of the ventral retina and the optic stalk, while the effects of Hh inhibition during optic vesicle stages were limited to the reduction of optic stalk size.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of two competence windows during which the Hh pathway differentially controls patterning of the eye region. In the first window, between the neural plate and the optic vesicle stages, Hh signalling exerts a global influence on eye dorsoventral polarity, contributing to the specification of optic stalk, ventral retina and dorsal retinal domains. In the second window, between optic vesicle and optic cup stages, this pathway plays a more limited role in the maintenance of the optic stalk domain. We speculate that this temporal regulation is important to coordinate dorsoventral patterning with morphogenesis and differentiation processes during eye development.},

abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells form orderly topographic connections with the tectum, establishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along the dorsal-ventral axis requires interactions between EphB and ephrin-B cell-surface molecules expressed as countergradients in both retina and tectum. We have discovered that the diffusible TGFss-related factor Radar (Gdf6a) is necessary and sufficient for activation of dorsal markers, such as Bmp4, Tbx5, Tbx2b, and Ephrin-B2, and suppression of the ventral marker Vax2 in the zebrafish retina. Radar mutant axons innervate only the dorsal half of the tectum, where they form a compressed retinotectal map. Wild-type cells transplanted into the dorsal retina are able to rescue the dorsal identity of nearby mutant cells. Moreover, Radar overexpression "dorsalizes" retinal ganglion cell identity in the ventral retina. We conclude that Radar is near the top of a signaling cascade that establishes dorsal-ventral positional information in the retina and controls the formation of the retinotectal map.},

abstract = {Wnt proteins are a large family of diffusible factors that play important roles in embryonic development, in-cluding axis patterning, cell fate specification, proliferation, and axon development. It was recently demonstrated that Ryk (receptor related to tyrosine kinase) is a conserved high-affinity Wnt receptor, and that Ryk-Wnt in-teractions guide corticospinal axons down the spinal cord during development. Here, we report that the Ryk-Wnt signal mediates the inhibition of corticospinal axon growth in the adult spinal cord. The expression of Wnt-5a is induced in reactive astrocytes around the injury site following a spinal cord injury. In vitro, Wnt-5a inhibits the neurite growth of postnatal cerebellar neurons by activating RhoA=Rho-kinase. In rats with thoracic spinal cord contusion, intrathecal administration of a neutralizing antibody to Ryk resulted in significant axonal growth of the corticospinal tract and enhanced functional recovery. Thus, reexpression of the embryonic repulsive cues in adult tissues contributes to the failure of axon regeneration in the central nervous system.},

In zebrafish, Wnts, which bind the Frizzled (Fz)-like domain in MuSK, are required for prepatterning, suggesting that Wnts may contribute to prepatterning and neuromuscular development in mammals. We show that prepatterning in mice requires Lrp4 but not the MuSK Fz-like domain. In contrast, prepatterning in zebrafish requires the MuSK Fz-like domain but not Lrp4. Despite these differences, neuromuscular synapse formation in zebrafish and mice share similar mechanisms, requiring Lrp4, MuSK, and neuronal Agrin but not the MuSK Fz-like domain or Wnt production from muscle.

abstract = {Cortical malformations resulting from aberrant brain development can be associated with mental retardation, dyslexia, and intractable forms of epilepsy. Despite emerging interest in the pathology and etiology of cortical malformations, little is known about the phenotype of cells within these lesions. In utero exposure to the DNA methylating agent methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) during a critical stage in neurodevelopment results in animals with distinct clusters of displaced neurons in hippocampus, i.e. nodular heterotopia. Here we examined the molecular and electrophysiological properties of cells within hippocampal heterotopia using rats exposed to MAM during gestation. Molecular analysis revealed that heterotopic cells do not express mRNA markers normally found in hippocampal pyramidal cells or dentate granule cells (SCIP, Math-2, Prox-1, neuropilin-2). In contrast, Id-2 mRNA, normally abundant in Layer II-III supragranular neocortical neurons but not in CA1 pyramidal neurons, was prominently expressed in hippocampal heterotopia. Current-clamp analysis of the firing properties of heterotopic neurons revealed a striking similarity with supragranular cortical neurons. In particular, both cells were characterized by small hyperpolarizing 'sag' potentials, high input resistance values, slow spike-train after hyperpolarizations, and the absence of a depolarizing after potential. Normotopic CA1 pyramidal neurons (e.g. pyramidal cells with normal lamination adjacent to a heterotopia) in the MAM brain exhibited molecular and electrophysiological properties that were nearly identical to those of age-matched CA1 pyramidal neurons from control rats. We conclude that neuronal heterotopiae in the hippocampus of MAM-exposed rats are comprised of neurons with a Layer II-III supragranular cortex phenotype. The MAM model, therefore, may serve as a useful tool in examination of the factors influencing aberrant brain development and epilepsy. {\textcopyright} 2002 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Afterwards, in an identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received painful thermal stimulation. In the test phase, pain ratings were increased in both groups under threat. Group comparisons show elevated responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the CT group, and higher activation of the midcingulate gyrus (MCC) in the IT group. Psychophysiological interaction analyses in CT demonstrated elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison of pain under threat vs. SAFETY In IT, the same comparison revealed elevated functional connectivity of the MCC and the insula.

abstract = {Regionalization is a critical, highly conserved step in the development of the vertebrate brain. Discrepancies exist in how regionalization of the anterior vertebrate forebrain is conceived since the "preoptic area" is proposed to be a part of the telencephalon in tetrapods but not in teleost fish. To gain insight into this complex morphogenesis, formation of the anterior forebrain was analyzed in 3D over time in zebrafish embryos, combining visualization of proliferation and differentiation markers, with that of developmental genes. We found that the region containing the preoptic area behaves as a coherent morphogenetic entity, organized around the optic recess and located between telencephalon and hypothalamus. This optic recess region (ORR) makes clear borders with its neighbor areas and expresses a specific set of genes (dlx2a, sim1a and otpb). We thus propose that the anterior forebrain (secondary prosencephalon) in teleosts contains three morphogenetic entities (telencephalon, ORR and hypothalamus), instead of two (telencephalon and hypothalamus). The ORR in teleosts could correspond to "telencephalic stalk area" and "alar hypothalamus" in tetrapods, resolving current inconsistencies in the comparison of basal forebrain among vertebrates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND In the adult hippocampus new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem cells (NSCs) present at the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. This process is controlled by Wnt signaling, which plays a complex role in regulating multiple steps of neurogenesis including maintenance, proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells and the development of newborn neurons. Differential effects of Wnt signaling during progression of neurogenesis could be mediated by cell-type specific expression of Wnt receptors. Here we studied the potential role of Frizzled-1 (FZD1) receptor in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. RESULTS In the adult dentate gyrus, we determined that FZD1 is highly expressed in NSCs, neural progenitors and immature neurons. Accordingly, FZD1 is expressed in cultured adult hippocampal progenitors isolated from mouse brain. To evaluate the role of this receptor in vivo we targeted FZD1 in newborn cells using retroviral-mediated RNA interference. FZD1 knockdown resulted in a marked decrease in the differentiation of newborn cells into neurons and increased the generation of astrocytes, suggesting a regulatory role for the receptor in cell fate commitment. In addition, FZD1 knockdown induced an extended migration of adult-born neurons within the granule cell layer. However, no differences were observed in total dendritic length and dendritic arbor complexity between control and FZD1-deficient newborn neurons. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that FZD1 regulates specific stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, being required for neuronal differentiation and positioning of newborn neurons into the granule cell layer, but not for morphological development of adult-born granule neurons.},

@article{Mosca2017,
abstract = {Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 preferentially localizes to excitatory neuron terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory) synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.},

abstract = {The balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses is crucial for normal brain function. Wnt proteins stimulate synapse formation by increasing synaptic assembly. However, it is unclear whether Wnt signaling differentially regulates the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt7a preferentially stimulates excitatory synapse formation and function. In hippocampal neurons, Wnt7a increases the number of excitatory synapses, whereas inhibitory synapses are unaffected. Wnt7a or postsynaptic expression of Dishevelled-1 (Dvl1), a core Wnt signaling component, increases the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Wnt7a increases the density and maturity of dendritic spines, whereas Wnt7a-Dvl1-deficient mice exhibit defects in spine morphogenesis and mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Using a postsynaptic reporter for Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, we demonstrate that Wnt7a rapidly activates CaMKII in spines. Importantly, CaMKII inhibition abolishes the effects of Wnt7a on spine growth and excitatory synaptic strength. These data indicate that Wnt7a signaling is critical to regulate spine growth and synaptic strength through the local activation of CaMKII at dendritic spines. Therefore, aberrant Wnt7a signaling may contribute to neurological disorders in which excitatory signaling is disrupted.},

In the cerebellum, mossy fibers undergo extensive remodeling as they contact several granule cells and form complex, multisynaptic glomerular rosettes. Here we show that granule cells secrete factors that induce axon and growth cone remodeling in mossy fibers. This effect is blocked by the WNT antagonist, sFRP-1, and mimicked by WNT-7a, which is expressed by granule cells. WNT-7a also induces synapsin I clustering at remodeled areas of mossy fibers, a preliminary step in synaptogenesis. Wnf-7a mutant mice show a delay in the morphological maturation of glomerular rosettes and in the accumulation of synapsin I. We propose that WNT-7a can function as a synaptogenic factor.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) bind to a subset of growth factors on the surface of cells and elicit responses with broad roles in developmental and postnatal cellular processes. Receptors in this subclass consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain harboring a catalytic tyrosine kinase and regulatory sequences that are phosphorylated either by the receptor itself or by various interacting proteins. Once activated, RTKs bind signaling molecules and recruit effector proteins to mediate downstream cellular responses through various intracellular signaling pathways. In this chapter, we highlight the role of a subset of RTK families in regulating the activity of neural crest cells (NCCs) and the development of their derivatives in mammalian systems. NCCs are migratory, multipotent cells that can be subdivided into four axial populations, cranial, cardiac, vagal, and trunk. These cells migrate throughout the vertebrate embryo along defined pathways and give rise to unique cell types and structures. Interestingly, individual RTK families often have specific functions in a subpopulation of NCCs that contribute to the diversity of these cells and their derivatives in the mammalian embryo. We additionally discuss current methods used to investigate RTK signaling, including genetic, biochemical, large-scale proteomic, and biosensor approaches, which can be applied to study intracellular signaling pathways active downstream of this receptor subclass during NCC development.},

The identity of these signals is largely unknown. Here we show that adult hippocampal stem/progenitor cells (AHPs) express receptors and signalling components for Wnt proteins, which are key regulators of neural stem cell behaviour in embryonic development. We also show that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is active and that Wnt3 is expressed in the hippocampal neurogenic niche. Overexpression of Wnt3 is sufficient to increase neurogenesis from AHPs in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, blockade of Wnt signalling reduces neurogenesis from AHPs in vitro and abolishes neurogenesis almost completely in vivo.

Here, we show that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell synapses differ in size, shape, and glutamate receptor expression depending on the laterality of presynaptic origin. CA1 synapses receiving neuronal input from the right CA3 pyramidal cells are larger and have more perforated PSD and a GluR1 expression level twice as high as those receiving input from the left CA3. The synaptic density of GluR1 increases as the size of a synapse increases, whereas that of NR2B decreases because of the relatively constant NR2B expression in CA1 regardless of synapse size. Densities of other major glutamate receptor subunits show no correlation with synapse size, thus resulting in higher net expression in synapses having right input.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep is characterized by extended periods of quiescence and reduced responsiveness to sensory stimuli. Animals ranging from insects to mammals adapt to environments with limited food by suppressing sleep and enhancing their response to food cues, yet little is known about the genetic and evolutionary relationship between these processes. The blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus is a powerful model for elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying behavioral evolution. A. mexicanus comprises an extant ancestral-type surface dwelling morph and at least five independently evolved cave populations. Evolutionary convergence on sleep loss and vibration attraction behavior, which is involved in prey seeking, have been documented in cavefish raising the possibility that enhanced sensory responsiveness underlies changes in sleep.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We established a system to study sleep and vibration attraction behavior in adult A. mexicanus and used high coverage quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to investigate the functional and evolutionary relationship between these traits. Analysis of surface-cave F2 hybrid fish and an outbred cave population indicates that independent genetic factors underlie changes in sleep/locomotor activity and vibration attraction behavior. High-coverage QTL mapping with genotyping-by-sequencing technology identify two novel QTL intervals that associate with locomotor activity and include the narcolepsy-associated tp53 regulating kinase. These QTLs represent the first genomic localization of locomotor activity in cavefish and are distinct from two QTLs previously identified as associating with vibration attraction behavior.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results localize genomic regions underlying sleep/locomotor and sensory changes in cavefish populations and provide evidence that sleep loss evolved independently from enhanced sensory responsiveness.},

Nonetheless, evidence exists that interactions between the immune and nervous systems control major brain regenerative processes ranging from physiological or pathological (reparative) regeneration to neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Recent studies describe deregulated Wnt-Fzd signaling in degenerative and inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and the expression of Wnt signaling components in the immune system, and in immune-like cells of the mammalian CNS. This would suggest a likely involvement of Wnts in inflammation-driven brain damage and inflammation-directed brain repair.

Because several other inductive events in development are mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and because phosphotyrosine staining within muscle fibers is concentrated at synaptic sites, one possibility is that synapse-inducing signals are transduced by a RTK within the muscle fiber. We have used PCR to search for tyrosine kinases within the electric organ of the electric ray Torpedo californica, since this tissue is homologous to muscle but is much more densely innervated and is therefore a rich source of synaptic molecules. We have isolated a RTK that is specifically expressed in electric organ and skeletal muscle. The kinase domain of this receptor is related to the trk family of neurotrophin receptors, but unlike any previously described receptor, the extracellular region of this Torpedo RTK contains a kringle domain close to the transmembrane domain.},

abstract = {Wnt signaling regulates neural stem cell (NSC) function and development throughout an individual's lifetime. Intriguingly, adult hippocampal progenitors (AHPs) produce several Wnts, and the intracellular machinery necessary to respond to them, creating the potential for an active autocrine-signaling loop within this stem cell niche. However, the standard luciferase-based Wnt assay failed to detect this signaling loop. This assay is inherently less temporally sensitive to activity among a population of unsynchronized proliferating cells because it relies on the rapidly degrading reporter luciferase. We circumvented this limitation using a promoter assay that employs green fluorescent protein (GFP), as a relatively long-lived reporter of canonical Wnt activity. We found that at baseline, AHPs secreted functional Wnt that self-stimulates low-level canonical Wnt signaling. Elimination baseline Wnt activity, via application of an extracellular Wnt antagonist promoted neurogenesis, based on a combination of unbiased gene expression analysis and cell-fate analysis. A detailed clonal analysis of progenitors transduced with specific intracellular antagonists of canonical signaling, either Axin or truncated cadherin (beta-catenin sequestering), revealed that loss of baseline signaling depletes the population of multipotent precursors, thereby driving an increasing fraction to assume a committed cell fate (i.e., unipotent progenitors). Similarly, baseline Wnt signaling repressed differentiation of human NSCs. Although the specific Wnts produced by neural precursors vary with age and between species, their effects remain remarkably consistent. In sum, this study establishes that autonomous Wnt signaling is a conserved feature of the neurogenic niche that preserves the delicate balance between NSC maintenance and differentiation.},

abstract = {The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase1 alpha subunit 3 (ATP1$\alpha$(3)) is one of many essential components that maintain the sodium and potassium gradients across the plasma membrane in animal cells. Mutations in the ATP1A3 gene cause rapid-onset of dystonia parkinsonism (RDP), a rare movement disorder characterized by sudden onset of dystonic spasms and slowness of movement. To achieve a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, we used immunohistochemical approaches to describe the regional and cellular distribution of ATP1$\alpha$(3) in the adult mouse brain. Our results show that localization of ATP1$\alpha$(3) is restricted to neurons, and it is expressed mostly in projections (fibers and punctuates), but cell body expression is also observed. We found high expression of ATP1$\alpha$(3) in GABAergic neurons in all nuclei of the basal ganglia (striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra), which is a key circuitry in the fine movement control. Several thalamic nuclei structures harboring connections to and from the cortex expressed high levels of the ATP1$\alpha$(3) isoform. Other structures with high expression of ATP1$\alpha$(3) included cerebellum, red nucleus, and several areas of the pons (reticulotegmental nucleus of pons). We also found high expression of ATP1$\alpha$(3) in projections and cell bodies in hippocampus; most of these ATP1$\alpha$(3)-positive cell bodies showed colocalization to GABAergic neurons. ATP1$\alpha$(3) expression was not significant in the dopaminergic cells of substantia nigra. In conclusion, and based on our data, ATP1$\alpha$(3) is widely expressed in neuronal populations but mainly in GABAergic neurons in areas and nuclei related to movement control, in agreement with RDP symptoms.},

In this study, we investigate the activity of Nodal, Hedgehog (Hh) and Fgf signals and Vax family homeodomain proteins in this patterning event. We show that zebrafish vax1 and vax2 are expressed in overlapping domains encompassing the ventral retina, optic stalks and preoptic area. Abrogation of Vax1 and Vax2 activity leads to a failure to close the choroid fissure and progressive expansion of retinal tissue into the optic nerve, finally resulting in a fusion of retinal neurons and pigment epithelium with forebrain tissue. We show that Hh signals acting through Smoothened act downstream of the Nodal pathway to promote Vax gene expression. However, in the absence of both Nodal and Hh signals, Vax genes are expressed revealing that other signals, which we show include Fgfs, contribute to Vax gene regulation. Finally, we show that Pax2.1 and Vax1/Vax2 are likely to act in parallel downstream of Hh activity and that the bel locus (yet to be cloned) mediates the ability of Hh-, and perhaps Fgf-, signals to induce Vax expression in the preoptic area. Taking all these results together, we present a model of the partitioning of the optic vesicle along its proximo-distal axis.},

We have examined the role of Wnt-3a signaling at the caudomedial margin of the developing cerebral cortex, the site of hippocampal development. We show that Wnt-3a acts locally to regulate the expansion of the caudomedial cortex, from which the hippocampus develops. In mice lacking Wnt-3a, caudomedial cortical progenitor cells appear to be specified normally, but then underproliferate. By mid-gestation, the hippocampus is missing or represented by tiny populations of residual hippocampal cells. Thus, Wnt-3a signaling is crucial for the normal growth of the hippocampus. We suggest that the coordination of growth with patterning may be a general role for Wnts during vertebrate development.},

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive and fatal loss of motor neurons. In ALS, there is a significant cell proliferation in response to neurodegeneration; however, the exact molecular mechanisms of cell proliferation and differentiation are unclear. The Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in neurodegenerative processes. Wnt3a, $\beta$-catenin, and Cyclin D1 are three key signaling molecules of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway. We determined the expression of Wnt3a, $\beta$-catenin, and Cyclin D1 in the adult spinal cord of SOD1G93AALS transgenic mice at different stages by RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence labeling techniques. We found that the mRNA and protein of Wnt3a and Cyclin D1 in the spinal cord of the ALS mice were upregulated compared to those in wild-type mice. In addition, $\beta$-catenin translocated from the cell membrane to the nucleus and subsequently activated transcription of the target gene, Cyclin D1. BrdU and Cyclin D1 double-positive cells were increased in the spinal cord of these mice. Moreover, Wnt3a, $\beta$-catenin, and Cyclin D1 were also expressed in both neurons and astrocytes. The expression of Wnt3a, $\beta$-catenin or Cyclin D1 in mature GFAP+astrocytes increased. Moreover, BrdU/Cyclin D1/GFAP triple-positive cells were detected in the ALS mice. Our findings suggest that neurodegeneration activates the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with glial proliferation in the adult spinal cord of ALS transgenic mice. This mechanism may be significant in clinical gene therapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

MuSK is activated in a complex spatio-temporal manner to cluster acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic (muscle) side of the synapse and to induce differentiation of the nerve terminal on the presynaptic side. The ligand for MuSK is LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-4), a transmembrane protein in muscle, whose binding affinity for MuSK is potentiated by agrin, a neuronally derived heparan-sulfate proteoglycan. In addition, Dok7, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, is also required for MuSK activation in vivo. This review focuses on the physical interplay between these proteins and MuSK for activation and downstream signaling, which culminates in NMJ formation.

abstract = {Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is essential for each step in neuromuscular synapse formation. Before innervation, MuSK initiates postsynaptic differentiation, priming the muscle for synapse formation. Approaching motor axons recognize the primed, or prepatterned, region of muscle, causing motor axons to stop growing and differentiate into specialized nerve terminals. MuSK controls presynaptic differentiation by causing the clustering of Lrp4, which functions as a direct retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation. Developing synapses are stabilized by neuronal Agrin, which is released by motor nerve terminals and binds to Lrp4, a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, stimulating further association between Lrp4 and MuSK and increasing MuSK kinase activity. In addition, MuSK phosphorylation is stimulated by an inside-out ligand, docking protein-7 (Dok-7), which is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated MuSK and increases MuSK kinase activity. Mutations in MuSK and in genes that function in the MuSK signaling pathway, including Dok-7, cause congenital myasthenia, and autoantibodies to MuSK, Lrp4, and acetylcholine receptors are responsible for myasthenia gravis.},

abstract = {Cave fish provide a model system for exploring the genetic basis of regressive evolution. A proposal that regressive evolution (for example, eye loss) may result from pleiotropy, by selection on constructive traits (for example, improved taste) has received considerable recent interest as it contra-dicts the theory that regressive evolution results from neutral evolution. In this study, these theories are reviewed by placing the classical and molecular genetic studies of cave fish in a common framework. Sequence data and the wide range of intermediate sized eyes in hybrids between surface and cave fish suggest that currently there is no strong evidence supporting the notion that structural eye genes have been afflicted by destructive mutations. The hedgehog genes, which are suggested to reduce the primordial eye cup size in cavefish by expanded expression, are also not mutated. The as yet unidentified 'eye genes' revealed by crossing experiments seem primarily responsible for eye regression and determine eye development through hedge-hog. Hybrids between different eye-reduced cave popula-tions developing large 'back to surface eyes' support this. In such eyes, hh expression is restored by complementary restitution because of the recombination of 'eye genes', which were subjected to different destructive mutations in separately evolving cave fish populations. All regressive and constructive cave fish traits can be considered to result from genetic modules, each showing a comparable pattern of expression. The constructive and regressive modules are shown to inherit independently from each other, which does not support the view that eye regression is a spin off effect of the improvement of beneficial traits through pleiotropy.},

abstract = {MuSK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that initiates the formation of neuromuscular junctions in response to agrin. Little is known about the ligand-induced activation and kinase-dependent signalling that leads to the clustering of acetylcholine receptors. The ectodomain of these molecule is composed of four Ig-like domains. We describe here the isolation of a novel MuSK splice variant that lacks the third Ig-like domain in its ectodomain. The corresponding RNA is the result of alternative splicing which eliminates two exons. There is 10 times less mRNA for this shorter form than for the long form of MuSK and both forms are regulated coordinately. They decrease strongly after birth and are elevated in denervated muscle. Gene transfer by muscle injection of MuSK DNA into individual muscle fibers demonstrates that kinase-induced acetylcholine receptor clustering caused by overexpression of the two kinases does not depend on the presence of the third Ig-like domain.},

Here, we report how enhanced Shh midline signalling affects the evolution of telencephalic and diencephalic neuronal patterning in the blind cavefish Astyanax mexicanus, a teleost fish closely related to zebrafish. A comparison between cave- and surface-dwelling forms of Astyanax shows that cavefish display larger Shh expression in all anterior midline domains throughout development. This does not affect global forebrain regional patterning, but has several important consequences on specific regions and neuronal populations. First, we show expanded Nkx2.1a expression and higher levels of cell proliferation in the cavefish basal diencephalon and hypothalamus. Second, we uncover an Nkx2.1b-Lhx6-GABA-positive migratory pathway from the subpallium to the olfactory bulb, which is increased in size in cavefish. Finally, we observe heterochrony and enlarged Lhx7 expression in the cavefish basal forebrain. These specific increases in olfactory and hypothalamic forebrain components are Shh-dependent and therefore place the telencephalic midline organisers in a crucial position to modulate forebrain evolution through developmental events, and to generate diversity in forebrain neuronal patterning.},

Evidence from Aplysia, Drosophila, mice, and rats shows that CREB-dependent transcription is required for the cellular events underlying long-term but not short-term memory.

abstract = {Neural crest (NC) cells arise early in vertebrate development, migrate extensively and contribute to a diverse array of ectodermal and mesenchymal derivatives. Previous models of NC formation suggested derivation from neuralized ectoderm, via meso-ectodermal, or neural-non-neural ectoderm interactions. Recent studies using bird and amphibian embryos suggest an earlier origin of NC, independent of neural and mesodermal tissues. Here, we set out to generate a model in which to decipher signaling and tissue interactions involved in human NC induction. Our novel human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based model yields high proportions of multipotent NC cells (expressing SOX10, PAX7 and TFAP2A) in 5 days. We demonstrate a crucial role for WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling in launching NC development, while blocking placodal and surface ectoderm fates. We provide evidence of the delicate temporal effects of BMP and FGF signaling, and find that NC development is separable from neural and/or mesodermal contributions. We further substantiate the notion of a neural-independent origin of NC through PAX6 expression and knockdown studies. Finally, we identify a novel pre-neural border state characterized by early WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling targets that displays distinct responses to BMP and FGF signaling from the traditional neural border genes. In summary, our work provides a fast and efficient protocol for human NC differentiation under signaling constraints similar to those identified in vivo in model organisms, and strengthens a framework for neural crest ontogeny that is separable from neural and mesodermal fates.},

Enriched environment (EE) produced a robust and reversible increase in hippocampal stratum lucidum synapse numbers, mossy fiber terminal (LMT) numbers, and spine plus synapse densities at LMTs, whereas a distinct mechanism depending on Rab3a promoted LMT volume growth. In parallel, EE increased postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron Wnt7a/b levels. Inhibiting Wnt signaling through locally applied sFRP-1 suppressed the effects of EE on synapse numbers and further reduced synapse numbers in control mice. Wnt7 applied to CA3 mimicked the effects of EE on synapse and LMT numbers. CA3 Wnt7a/b levels were enhanced by excitatory activity and reduced by sFRP-1. Synapse numbers and Wnt7a/b levels peaked in mice aged 6-12 months; a decline in aged mice was reversed by EE. Therefore, behavioral experience specifically regulates adult global stratum lucidum synapse numbers and hippocampal network structure through Wnt signaling.},

In the future diencephalon, several genes with patterned expression have been identified, yet their specific functions and interactions between them are not well understood. We have uncovered a crucial role for one such gene, zic2a, during formation of the anterior diencephalon in zebrafish. We show that zic2a is required for transcription of the prethalamic markers arx and dlx2a. This function is required during early steps of prethalamic development, soon after its specification. zic genes are evolutionarily related to glis, transcription factors that mediate hedgehog signaling. Intriguingly, the hedgehog signaling pathway also acts to promote development of the prethalamus. We asked if zic2a interacts with hedgehog signaling in the context of forebrain development in zebrafish. Our data show that hedgehog signaling and zic2a function at different times, and therefore act in parallel pathways during forebrain development. Taken together, our results identify Zic2a as a novel regulator of prethalamic development, and show that it functions independently of hedgehog signaling. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we have correlated the loss and recovery of the nigrostriatal DAergic functionality upon acute MPTP exposure with extensive gene expression analysis at the level of the ventral midbrain (VM) and striata (Str) and found a major upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and wingless-type MMTV integration site1 (Wnt1), a key transcript involved in midbrain DAergic neurodevelopment. Wnt signaling components (including Frizzled-1 [Fzd-1] and $\beta$-catenin) were dynamically regulated during MPTP-induced DAergic degeneration and reactive glial activation. Activated astrocytes of the ventral midbrain were identified as candidate source of Wnt1 by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR in vitro. Blocking Wnt/Fzd signaling with Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) counteracted astrocyte-induced neuroprotection against MPP+toxicity in primary mesencephalic astrocyte-neuron cultures, in vitro. Moreover, astroglial-derived factors, including Wnt1, promoted neurogenesis and DAergic neurogenesis from adult midbrain stem/neuroprogenitor cells, in vitro. Conversely, lack of Wnt1 transcription in response to MPTP in middle-aged mice and failure of DAergic neurons to recover were reversed by pharmacological activation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling, in vivo, thus suggesting MPTP-reactive astrocytes in situ and Wnt1 as candidate components of neuroprotective/neurorescue pathways in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Using unbiased cluster analysis, we show that there are two morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct principal cell types that carry hippocampal output. We show further that these two cell types are inversely modulated by the synergistic action of glutamate and acetylcholine acting on metabotropic receptors that are central to hippocampal function. Combined with prior connectivity studies, our results support a model of hippocampal processing in which the two pyramidal cell types are predominantly segregated into two parallel pathways that process distinct modalities of information.},

Here we show that GSK3$\beta$ mediates an interaction between two major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD). In rat hippocampal slices, GSK3$\beta$ inhibitors block the induction of LTD. Furthermore, the activity of GSK3$\beta$ is enhanced during LTD via activation of PP1. Conversely, following the induction of LTP, there is inhibition of GSK3$\beta$ activity. This regulation of GSK3$\beta$ during LTP involves activation of NMDA receptors and the PI3K-Akt pathway and disrupts the ability of synapses to undergo LTD for up to 1 hr. We conclude that the regulation of GSK3$\beta$ activity provides a powerful mechanism to preserve information encoded during LTP from erasure by subsequent LTD, perhaps thereby permitting the initial consolidation of learnt information. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Small eye primordia are formed during cavefish embryogenesis, which later arrest in development, degenerate and sink into the orbits. Eye degeneration is caused by apoptosis of the embryonic lens, and transplanting a surface fish embryonic lens into a cavefish optic cup can restore a complete eye. Here we show that sonic hedgehog (shh) and tiggy-winkle hedgehog (twhh) gene expression is expanded along the anterior embryonic midline in several different cavefish populations.

abstract = {Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) is an essential receptor tyrosine kinase for the establishment and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Activation of MuSK by agrin, a neuronally derived heparan-sulfate proteoglycan, and LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-4), the agrin receptor, leads to clustering of acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic side of the NMJ. The ectodomain of MuSK comprises three immunoglobulin-like domains and a cysteine-rich domain (Fz-CRD) related to those in Frizzled proteins, the receptors for Wnts. Here, we report the crystal structure of the MuSK Fz-CRD at 2.1 {\AA} resolution. The structure reveals a five-disulfide-bridged domain similar to CRDs of Frizzled proteins but with a divergent C-terminal region. An asymmetric dimer present in the crystal structure implicates surface hydrophobic residues that may function in homotypic or heterotypic interactions to mediate co-clustering of MuSK, rapsyn, and acetylcholine receptors at the NMJ. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Animals inhabiting the darkness of caves are generally blind and de-pigmented, regardless of the phylum they belong to. Survival in this environment is an enormous challenge, the most obvious being to find food and mates without the help of vision, and the loss of eyes in cave animals is often accompanied by an enhancement of other sensory apparatuses. Here we review the recent literature describing developmental biology and molecular evolution studies in order to discuss the evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptation to life in the dark. We conclude that both genetic drift (neutral hypothesis) and direct and indirect selection (selective hypothesis) occurred together during the loss of eyes in cave animals. We also identify some future directions of research to better understand adaptation to total darkness, for which integrative analyses relying on evo-devo approaches associated with thorough ecological and population genomic studies should shed some light.},

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a synapse formed between motoneurons and skeletal muscle fibers that is wrapped by Schwann cells (SCs). It is essential for controlling muscle contraction. NMJ formation requires intimate interactions among motoneurons, muscles, and SCs.

abstract = {Wnts are secreted proteins that are essential for a wide array of developmental and physiological processes. They signal across the plasma membrane by interacting with serpentine receptors of the Frizzled (Fz) family and members of the low-density-lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) family. Activation of Fz-LRP promotes the stability and nuclear localization of -catenin by compromising the ability of a multiprotein complex containing axin, adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) to target it for degradation and block its nuclear import. The Fz-LRP receptor complex probably accomplishes this by generating multiple signals in the cytoplasm. These involve activation of Dishevelled (Dsh), possibly through trimeric G proteins and LRP-mediated axin binding and/or degradation. However, individual Wnts and Fzs can activate both -catenin-dependent and - independent pathways, and Fz co-receptors such as LRP probably provide some of this specificity. Additional, conflicting data concern the role of the atypical receptor tyrosine kinase Ryk, which might mediate Wnt signaling independently of Fz and/or function as a Fz co-receptor in some cells.},

abstract = {For nearly as long as lithium has been in clinical use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, depression, and other conditions, investigators have attempted to characterize its effects on behaviors in rodents. Lithium consistently decreases exploratory activity, rearing, aggression, and amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion; and it increases the sensitivity to pilocarpine-induced seizures, decreases immobility time in the forced swim test, and attenuates reserpine-induced hypolocomotion. Lithium also predictably induces conditioned taste aversion and alterations in circadian rhythms. The modulation of stereotypy, sensitization, and reward behavior are less consistent actions of the drug. These behavioral models may be relevant to human symptoms and to clinical endophenotypes. It is likely that the actions of lithium in a subset of these animal models are related to the therapeutic efficacy, as well the side effects, of the drug. We conclude with a brief discussion of various molecular mechanisms by which these lithium-sensitive behaviors may be mediated, and comment on the ways in which rat and mouse models can be used more effectively in the future to address persistent questions about the therapeutically relevant molecular actions of lithium. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The teleost Astyanax mexicanus is a single species consisting of two radically different forms: a sighted pigmented surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and a blind depigmented cave-dwelling form (cavefish). The two forms of Astyanax have favorable attributes, including descent from a common ancestor, ease of laboratory culture, and the ability to perform genetic analysis, permitting their use as a model system to explore questions in evolution and development. Here, we review current research on the molecular, cellular, and developmental mechanisms underlying the loss of eyes and pigmentation in Astyanax cavefish. Although functional eyes are lacking in adults, cavefish embryos begin to develop eye primordia, which subsequently degenerate. The major cause of eye degeneration appears to be apoptotic cell death of the lens, which prevents the growth of other optic tissues, including the retina. Ultimately, the loss of the eye is the cause of craniofacial differences between cavefish and surface fish. Lens apoptosis is induced by enhanced activity of the Hedgehog signaling system along the cavefish embryonic midline. The absence of melanin pigmentation in cavefish is due to a block in the ability of undifferentiated melanoblasts to accumulate L-tyrosine, the precursor of L-DOPA and melanin, in melanosomes. Genetic analysis has shown that this defect is caused by a hypomorphic mutation in the p/oca2 gene encoding an integral melanosomal membrane protein. We discuss how current studies of eye and pigment regression have revealed some of the mechanisms in which cavefish development has been changed during evolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Tg2576 transgenic mouse is an extensively characterized animal model for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similar to AD, these mice suffer from progressive decline in several forms of declarative memory including contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition (NOR). Recent work on this and other AD animal models suggests that initial cognitive deficits are due to synaptic dysfunction that, with the correct intervention, are fully treatable. We recently reported that acute calcineurin (CaN) inhibition with FK506 ameliorates one form of declarative memory (contextual fear conditioning) impairment in 5 months old Tg2576. This study tested whether acute CaN inhibition rescues deficits in an additional form of declarative memory, spontaneous object recognition, by employing the NOR paradigm. Furthermore, we determined whether FK506 rescue of NOR deficits depends on the retention interval employed and therefore is restricted to short-term, intermediate-term, or long-term memory (STM, ITM or LTM, respectively). In object recognition, Tg2576 are unimpaired when NOR is tested as a STM task and CaN inhibition with FK506 does not influence NOR STM performance in Tg2576 or WT mice. Tg2576 were impaired in NOR compared to WT mice when a 4 or 24 h retention interval was employed to model ITM and LTM, respectively. Acute CaN inhibition prior to and during the training session reversed these deficits in Tg2576 mice with no effect on WT performance. Our findings demonstrate that aberrant CaN activity mediates object recognition deficits in 5 months old Tg2576 when NOR is employed as a test for ITM and LTM. In human AD, CaN inhibition may lead the way for therapeutics to improve declarative memory performance as demonstrated in a mouse model for AD. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The sighted surface-dwelling (surface fish, SF) and the blind cave-living (cavefish, CF) forms of Astyanax mexicanus offer a unique opportunity to study the evolutionary changes in developmental mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration. Previous data have shown the role of increased midline Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling in cavefish eye degeneration (Yamamoto et al. [2004] Nature 431:844-847). Here, we have compared the major steps of eye development in SF and CF between 14 hours and 5 days of development. We have analyzed cell proliferation through PCNA and phospho-histone H3 staining and apoptosis through TUNEL and live LysoTracker analysis. We have assessed the expression of the major eye development signalling factors Shh and Fgf8, and the eye patterning genes Pax6, Lhx2, Lhx9, and Vax1, together with the differentiation marker GAD65. We show that eye development is retarded in CF and that cell proliferation in CF retina is proportionately similar to SF during early development, yet the retina degenerates after massive apoptosis in the lens and widespread cell death throughout the neuroretina. Moreover, and surprisingly, the signalling, patterning, and differentiation processes leading to the establishment of retinal layers and cell types happen almost normally in CF, although some signs of disorganization, slight heterochronies, and a lack of expression gradients are observable. Our data demonstrate that the evolutionary process of eye degeneration in the blind CF does not occur because of patterning defects of the retina and are consistent with the proposed scenario in which the trigger for eye degeneration in CF is lens apoptosis.},

abstract = {GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) play a significant role in mediating fast synaptic inhibition and it is the main inhibitory receptor in the CNS. The role of Wnt signaling in coordinating synapse structure and function in the mature CNS is poorly understood. In previous studies we found that Wnt ligands can modulate excitatory synapses through remodeling both presynaptic and postsynaptic regions. In this current study we provide evidence for the effect of Wnt-5a on postsynaptic GABA(A)-Rs. We observed that Wnt-5a induces surface expression and maintenance of this receptor in the neuronal membrane. The evoked IPSC recordings in rat hippocampal slice indicate that Wnt-5a can regulates postsynaptically the hippocampal inhibitory synapses. We found also that Wnt-5a: (a) induces the insertion and clustering of GABA(A)-Rs in the membrane; (b) increases the amplitude of GABA-currents due exclusively to postsynaptic mechanisms; (c) does not affect the endocytic process, but increases the receptor recycling. Finally, all these effects on the GABA(A)-Rs are mediated by the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Therefore, we postulate that Wnt-5a, by activation of CaMKII, induces the recycling of functional GABA(A)-Rs on the mature hippocampal neurons.},

abstract = {Wnt proteins play a crucial role in several aspects of neuronal circuit formation. Wnts can signal through different receptors including Frizzled, Ryk and Ror2. In the hippocampus, Wnt7a stimulates the formation of synapses; however, its receptor remains poorly characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Frizzled-5 (Fz5) is expressed during the peak of synaptogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. Fz5 is present in synaptosomes and colocalizes with the pre- and postsynaptic markers vGlut1 and PSD-95. Expression of Fz5 during early stages of synaptogenesis increases the number of presynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons. Conversely, Fz5 knockdown or the soluble Fz5-CRD domain (Fz5CRD), which binds to Wnt7a, block the ability of Wnt7a to stimulate synaptogenesis. Increased neuronal activity induced by K+ depolarization or by high-frequency stimulation (HFS), known to induce synapse formation, raises the levels of Fz5 at the cell surface. Importantly, both stimuli increase the localization of Fz5 at synapses, an effect that is blocked by Wnt antagonists or Fz5CRD. Conversely, low-frequency stimulation, which reduces the number of synapses, decreases the levels of surface Fz5 and the percentage of synapses containing the receptor. Interestingly, Fz5CRD abolishes HFS-induced synapse formation. Our results indicate that Fz5 mediates the synaptogenic effect of Wnt7a and that its localization to synapses is regulated by neuronal activity, a process that depends on endogenous Wnts. These findings support a model where neuronal activity and Wnts increase the responsiveness of neurons to Wnt signalling by recruiting Fz5 receptor at synaptic sites.},

Mutations in TBX5 cause Holt-Oram syndrome, an autosomal dominant human "heart-hand" condition characterised by upper limb and heart malformations. In zebrafish, embryos with compromised tbx5 function show a complete absence of pectoral fins, whereas heart and eye development are not so highly disturbed. Here, we identify a new tbx5 gene in zebrafish that we have called tbx5b. This duplicate gene is present in all teleost genomes whose sequence is available, suggesting it resulted from the teleost-specific genome duplication event that took place during fish evolution. We show that tbx5b has lost the characteristic forelimb/pectoral fin expression of Tbx5 genes but has retained the eye and heart expression, partially overlapping with that of its paralogue, now referred to as tbx5a. Functional redundancy of tbx5a and tbx5b in the eye and heart would therefore explain the mild phenotypes observed during development of these organs in fish embryos with compromised tbx5a function. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The loss of phenotypic characters is a common feature of evolution. Cave organisms provide excellent models for investigating the underlying patterns and processes governing the evolutionary loss of phenotypic traits. The blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, represents a particularly strong model for both developmental and genetic analyses as these fish can be raised in the laboratory and hybridized with conspecific surface form counterparts to produce large F2 pedigrees. As studies have begun to illuminate the genetic bases for trait evolution in these cavefish, it has become increasingly important to understand these phenotypic changes within the context of cavefish origins. Understanding these origins is a challenge. For instance, widespread convergence on similar features renders morphological characters less informative. In addition, current and past gene flow between surface and cave forms have complicated the delineation of particular cave populations. RESULTS Past population-level analyses have sought to: 1) estimate at what time in the geological past cave forms became isolated from surface-dwelling ancestors, 2) define the extent to which cave form populations originated from a common invasion (single origin hypothesis) or several invasions (multiple origin hypothesis), and 3) clarify the role of geological and climatic events in Astyanax cavefish evolution. In recent years, thanks to the combined use of morphological and genetic data, a much clearer picture has emerged regarding the origins of Astyanax cavefish. CONCLUSIONS The consensus view, based on several recent studies, is that cave forms originated from at least two distinct ancestral surface-dwelling stocks over the past several million years. In addition, each stock gave rise to multiple invasions of the subterranean biotope. The older stock is believed to have invaded the El Abra caves at least three times while the new stock separately invaded the northern Guatemala and western Micos caves. This renewed picture of Astyanax cavefish origins will help investigators draw conclusions regarding the evolution of phenotypic traits through parallelism versus convergence. Additionally, it will help us understand how the presence of cave-associated traits in old versus young cave populations may be influenced by the time since isolation in the cave environment.

abstract = {The NeuN protein is localized in nuclei and perinuclear cytoplasm of most of the neurons in the central nervous system of mammals. Monoclonal antibodies to the NeuN protein have been actively used in the immunohistochemical research of neuronal differentiation to assess the functional state of neurons in norm and pathology for more than 20 years. Recently, NeuN antibodies have begun to be applied in the differential morphological diagnosis of cancer. However, the structure of the protein, which can be revealed by antibodies to NeuN, remained unknown until recently, and the functions of the protein are still not fully clear. In the present mini-review, data on NeuN accumulated so far are summarized and analyzed. Data on the structure and properties of the protein, its isoforms, intracellular localization, and hypothesized functions are reported. The application field of immunocytochemical detection of NeuN in scientific and clinical studies, as well as the difficulties in the interpretation of the obtained experimental data and their possible causes, is described in details.},

abstract = {Autism is a severe neurobehavioral syndrome, arising largely as an inherited disorder, which can arise from several diseases. Despite recent advances in identifying some genes that can cause autism, its underlying neurological mechanisms are uncertain. Autism is best conceptualized by considering the neural systems that may be defective in autistic individuals. Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system. Furthermore, the model suggests potential therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {Wnt proteins play a critical role in central nervous system development and have been implicated in several neuropathologies, including spinal cord injury (SCI). Ryk, an unconventional Wnt receptor, regulates axonal regeneration after SCI, although its expression pattern in this neuropathology remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to define the spatiotemporal and cellular pattern of Ryk expression after a contusive SCI in adult rats using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis. Under physiological conditions, Ryk is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and blood vessels, but not in oligodendrocytes, microglia, NG2+ glial precursor cells, or axonal projections. Following SCI, we observed an increase in Ryk mRNA expression from 24 h post-injury until 7 days post-injury, whereas its protein levels were significantly augmented at 7 and 14 days post-injury. Moreover, the spatial and cellular Ryk expression pattern was altered in the damaged tissue, where this receptor was observed in reactive astrocytes and microglia/macrophages, NG2+ glial precursors, fibronectin+ cells, oligodendrocytes, and axons. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Ryk is expressed in the unlesioned spinal cord and that, after SCI, its spatiotemporal and cellular expression pattern changed dramatically, being expressed in cells involved in the spinal cord response to damage.},

Although agrin has also been detected in central neurons, little is known about its role in the formation of their synapses. In the present study, the pattern of expression, localization and function of agrin in developing hippocampal neurons were analyzed. The results indicate that an increase in agrin protein levels precedes synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. This increase in agrin expression is accompanied by its extracellular deposition along the distal third of the axon. To investigate whether agrin plays a role during synapse formation, its expression in cultured hippocampal neurons was suppressed by means of antisense oligonucleotide treatment. The suppression of agrin expression results in the impairment of dendritic development and the formation of fewer synapses than in non-treated or sense-treated neurons. Moreover, this decreased synaptic density is accompanied by a selective inhibition of the clustering of GABA receptors. These results lead to the conclusion that agrin may be an important regulator of the maturation of dendrites and synaptogenesis in central neurons.},

abstract = {Left-right asymmetries have likely evolved to make optimal use of bilaterian nervous systems; however, little is known about the synaptic and circuit mechanisms that support divergence of function between equivalent structures in each hemisphere. Here we examined whether lateralized hippocampal memory processing is present in mice, where hemispheric asymmetry at the CA3-CA1 pyramidal neuron synapse has recently been demonstrated, with different spine morphology, glutamate receptor content, and synaptic plasticity, depending on whether afferents originate in the left or right CA3. To address this question, we used optogenetics to acutely silence CA3 pyramidal neurons in either the left or right dorsal hippocampus while mice performed hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. We found that unilateral silencing of either the left or right CA3 was sufficient to impair short-term memory. However, a striking asymmetry emerged in long-term memory, wherein only left CA3 silencing impaired performance on an associative spatial long-term memory task, whereas right CA3 silencing had no effect. To explore whether synaptic properties intrinsic to the hippocampus might contribute to this left-right behavioral asymmetry, we investigated the expression of hippocampal long-term potentiation. Following the induction of long-term potentiation by high-frequency electrical stimulation, synapses between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons were strengthened only when presynaptic input originated in the left CA3, confirming an asymmetry in synaptic properties. The dissociation of hippocampal long-term memory function between hemispheres suggests that memory is routed via distinct left-right pathways within the mouse hippocampus, and provides a promising approach to help elucidate the synaptic basis of long-term memory.},

Mutations in human TBX5 cause Holt-Oram syndrome, a condition characterized by heart and upper limb malformations. Tbx5-knockout mouse embryos have severely impaired forelimb and heart morphogenesis from the earliest stages of their development. However, zebrafish embryos with compromised tbx5 function show a complete absence of pectoral fins, while heart development is disturbed at significantly later developmental stages and eye development remains to be thoroughly analysed. We identified a novel tbx5 gene in zebrafish--tbx5b--that is co-expressed with its paralogue, tbx5a, in the developing eye and heart and hypothesized that functional redundancy could be occurring in these organs in embryos with impaired tbx5a function. We have now investigated the consequences of tbx5a and/or tbx5b downregulation in zebrafish to reveal that tbx5 genes have essential roles in the establishment of cardiac laterality, dorsoventral retina axis organization and pectoral fin development. Our data show that distinct relationships between tbx5 paralogues are required in a tissue-specific manner to ensure the proper morphogenesis of the three organs in which they are expressed. Furthermore, we uncover a novel role for tbx5 genes in the establishment of correct heart asymmetry in zebrafish embryos.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can dramatically increase levels of intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺). The association between Wnt5a/Frizzled-2 (wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family member 5a/Fzd2) signaling and Ca²⁺ cellular homeostasis in lower vertebrates has been well documented. However, little is known about Wnt5a/Fzd2 signaling in mammalian nerve cells, or whether Ca²⁺ accumulation after TBI is mediated through this pathway. We hypothesized that an activated Wnt5a/Fzd2 pathway following TBI may play a role in Ca²⁺ overloading. To elucidate the influence of Fzd2 and the Wnt5a signal transduction pathway on an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺, we assessed the expression of Wnt5a/Fzd2 in rat hippocampal cells both in vitro and in vivo. We found that transfection of the rat Fzd2 gene in rat neonatal hippocampal astrocytes significantly increased gene expressions of both Wnt5a and Fzd2 by fourfold when compared to non-transfected cells (P{\textless}0.01 in both cases). Expressions of the proteins Wnt5a and Fzd2 were significantly increased approximately two- and threefold, respectively, when compared to non-transfected control cells (P{\textless}0.01 in both cases). Moreover, intracellular Ca²⁺, as manifested by the fluorescent intensity of the intracellular Ca²⁺ indicator Fluo-3/AM, was significantly increased by 1.75-fold (P{\textless}0.01). The blocking of Fzd2 signaling using Stealth RNAi markedly inhibited the elevated gene and protein expression of Wnt5a in the transfected cells by two- and fourfold, respectively (P{\textless}0.01), and suppressed intracellular Ca²⁺ by 1.5-fold (P{\textless}0.01). Furthermore, in vivo, we demonstrated that TBI-induced dramatic upregulation of gene and protein expression of Wnt5a/Fzd2 by two- and fivefold (P{\textless}0.01) in injured hippocampi, and intracellular Ca²⁺ increased in isolated injured hippocampal cells. Whereas, the in vivo blocking of Fzd2 signaling by hippocampal delivery of Stealth RNAi and Invivofectamine significantly suppressed the increased gene and protein expression of Wnt5a and Fzd2 induced by TBI by 1- to 3.5-fold (P{\textless}0.01) and also inhibited Ca²⁺ accumulation by 1.5-fold (P{\textless}0.01). These findings demonstrated that the Wnt5a/Fzd2 signaling pathway contributed to increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ in nerve cells under physiological and pathological conditions. Furthermore, our findings provide evidence that specifically expressed components of this signal pathway, such as Wnt5a and Fzd2, are potential therapeutic targets following brain trauma.},

abstract = {Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is the most common congenital malformation of the forebrain in human. Several genes with essential roles during forebrain development have been identified because they cause HPE when mutated. Among these are genes that encode the secreted growth factor Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and the transcription factors Six3 and Zic2. In the mouse, Six3 and Shh activate each other's transcription, but a role for Zic2 in this interaction has not been tested. We demonstrate that in zebrafish, as in mouse, Hh signaling activates transcription of six3b in the developing forebrain. zic2a is also activated by Hh signaling, and represses six3b non-cell-autonomously, i.e. outside of its own expression domain, probably through limiting Hh signaling. Zic2a repression of six3b is essential for the correct formation of the prethalamus. The diencephalon-derived optic stalk (OS) and neural retina are also patterned in response to Hh signaling. We show that zebrafish Zic2a limits transcription of the Hh targets pax2a and fgf8a in the OS and retina. The effects of Zic2a depletion in the forebrain and in the OS and retina are rescued by blocking Hh signaling or by increasing levels of the Hh antagonist Hhip, suggesting that in both tissues Zic2a acts to attenuate the effects of Hh signaling. These data uncover a novel, essential role for Zic2a as a modulator of Hh-activated gene expression in the developing forebrain and advance our understanding of a key gene regulatory network that, when disrupted, causes HPE.},

Astyanax cavefish differ from surface fish in numerous traits, including the enhancement of non-visual sensory systems, and the loss of eyes and pigmentation. The genetic bases for these differences are not fully understood as genomic and transcriptomic data are lacking. We here present de novo transcriptome sequencing of embryonic and larval stages of a surface fish population and a cavefish population originating from the Pachon cave using the Sanger method. This effort represents the first large scale sequence and clone resource for the Astyanax research community. The analysis of these sequences show low levels of polymorphism in cavefish compared to surface fish, confirming previous studies on a small number of genes. A high proportion of the genes mutated in cavefish are known to be expressed in the zebrafish visual system. Such a high number of mutations in cavefish putative eye genes may be explained by relaxed selection for vision during the evolution in the absence of light. Based on these sequence differences, we provide a list of 11 genes that are potential candidates for having a role in cavefish visual system degeneration.},

abstract = {Trunk neural crest cells delaminate from the dorsal neural tube as an uninterrupted sheet; however, they convert into segmentally organized streams before migrating through the somitic territory. These neural crest cell streams join the segmental trajectories of pathfinding spinal motor axons, suggesting that interactions between these two cell types might be important for neural crest cell migration. Here, we show that in the zebrafish embryo migration of both neural crest cells and motor axons is temporally synchronized and spatially restricted to the center of the somite, but that motor axons are dispensable for segmental neural crest cell migration. Instead, we find that muscle-specific receptor kinase (MuSK) and its putative ligand Wnt11r are crucial for restricting neural crest cell migration to the center of each somite. Moreover, we find that blocking planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in somitic muscle cells also results in non-segmental neural crest cell migration. Using an F-actin biosensor we show that in the absence of MuSK neural crest cells fail to retract non-productive leading edges, resulting in non-segmental migration. Finally, we show that MuSK knockout mice display similar neural crest cell migration defects, suggesting a novel, evolutionarily conserved role for MuSK in neural crest migration. We propose that a Wnt11r-MuSK dependent, PCP-like pathway restricts neural crest cells to their segmental path.},

The NMJ forms in a series of steps that involve the exchange of signals among its three cellular components--nerve terminal, muscle fiber, and Schwann cell. Although essentially any motor axon can form NMJs with any muscle fiber, an additional set of cues biases synapse formation in favor of appropriate partners. The NMJ is functional at birth but undergoes numerous alterations postnatally. One step in maturation is the elimination of excess inputs, a competitive process in which the muscle is an intermediary. Once elimination is complete, the NMJ is maintained stably in a dynamic equilibrium that can be perturbed to initiate remodeling. NMJs regenerate following damage to nerve or muscle, but this process differs in fundamental ways from embryonic synaptogenesis. Finally, we consider the extent to which the NMJ is a suitable model for development of neuron-neuron synapses.},

abstract = {Wnt signaling has emerged in recent years as a major player in both nervous system development and adult synaptic plasticity. Of particular relevance to researchers studying learning and memory, Wnt signaling is critical for normal functioning of the hippocampus, a brain region that is essential for many types of memory formation and whose dysfunction is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. Impaired hippocampal Wnt signaling is implicated in several of these conditions, however, little is known about how Wnt signaling mediates hippocampal memory formation. This review will provide a general overview of Wnt signaling and discuss evidence demonstrating a key role for Wnt signaling in hippocampal memory formation in both normal and disease states. The regulation of Wnt signaling by ovarian sex steroid hormones will also be highlighted, given that the neuroprotection afforded by Wnt-hormone interactions may have significant implications for cognitive function in aging, neurodegenerative disease, and ischemic injury.},

abstract = {Wnt5a, a member of the Wnt gene family, encodes a cysteine-rich growth factor involved in signal transduction during growth and differentiation. The Fzd2 gene codes for a cell membrane receptor called Frizzled-2 have a structure similar to G protein coupled receptors. The extracellular N-terminal of the Fzd2 receptor has a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that binds Wnt ligands and thus primes the Wnt signal pathway. Downregulation of the Wnt signal pathway occurs in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, little is known about Wnt5a/Fzd2 signaling in mammalian nerve cells, and it is not clear whether Wnt5a or Fzd2 functioning are changed in ALS. The influence of Wnt5a and Fzd2 signal transduction pathway on ALS was investigated in adult SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice. Changes in Wnt5a and Fzd2 expression in the spinal cord of SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice (ALS), SOD1(G93A) transfected NSC-34 cells, and primary cultures of astrocytes from SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice were detected by immunofluorescent staining, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. The results provide further insight into the role of Wnt5a and Fzd2 in the pathogenesis of ALS transgenic mice, which provides evidence that should help in the search for treatments of ALS.},

Recent studies indicated that Wnt signaling modulates long term potentiation in adult hippocampal slices. We report here that different Wnt ligands are present in hippocampal neurons of rat embryo and adult rat, including Wnt-4, -5a, -7a, and -11. Wnt-7a acts as a canonical Wnt ligand in rat hippocampal neurons, stimulates clustering of presynaptic proteins, and induces recycling and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles as studied by FM dyes. Wnt-3a has a moderate effect on recycling of synaptic vesicles, and no effect of Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a was detected. Electrophysiological analysis on adult rat hippocampal slices indicates that Wnt-7a, but not Wnt-5a, increases neurotransmitter release in CA3-CA1 synapses by decreasing paired pulse facilitation and increasing the miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents frequency. These results indicate that the presynaptic function of rat hippocampal neurons is modulated by the canonical Wnt signaling.},

Experience-dependent plasticity occurs at synapses - the specialized points of contact between neurons where signaling occurs. However, the mechanisms that regulate the strength of synaptic signaling are not well understood. Here, we define a Wnt-signaling pathway that modifies synaptic strength in the adult nervous system by regulating the translocation of one class of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to synapses. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that mutations in CWN-2 (Wnt ligand), LIN-17 (Frizzled), CAM-1 (Ror receptor tyrosine kinase), or the downstream effector DSH-1 (disheveled) result in similar subsynaptic accumulations of ACR-16/$\alpha$7 AChRs, a consequent reduction in synaptic current, and predictable behavioral defects. Photoconversion experiments revealed defective translocation of ACR-16/$\alpha$7 to synapses in Wnt-signaling mutants. Using optogenetic nerve stimulation, we demonstrate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and its dependence on ACR-16/$\alpha$7 translocation mediated by Wnt signaling via LIN-17/CAM-1 heteromeric receptors. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Natural variations in sensory systems constitute adaptive responses to the environment. Here, we compared sensory placode development in the blind cave-adapted morph and the eyed river-dwelling morph of Astyanax mexicanus Focusing on the lens and olfactory placodes, we found a trade-off between these two sensory components in the two morphs: from neural plate stage onwards, cavefish have larger olfactory placodes and smaller lens placodes. In a search for developmental mechanisms underlying cavefish sensory evolution, we analyzed the roles of Shh, Fgf8 and Bmp4 signaling, which are known to be fundamental in patterning the vertebrate head and are subtly modulated in space and time during cavefish embryogenesis. Modulating these signaling systems at the end of gastrulation shifted the balance toward a larger olfactory derivative. Olfactory tests to assess potential behavioral outcomes of such developmental evolution revealed that Astyanax cavefish are able to respond to a 10(5)-fold lower concentration of amino acids than their surface-dwelling counterparts. We suggest that similar evolutionary developmental mechanisms may be used throughout vertebrates to drive adaptive sensory specializations according to lifestyle and habitat.},

abstract = {Many developmental processes have evolved through natural selection, yet in only a few cases do we understand if and how a change of developmental process produces a benefit. For example, many studies in evolutionary biology have investigated the developmental mechanisms that lead to novel structures in an animal, but only a few have addressed if these structures actually benefit the animal at the behavioral level of prey hunting and mating. As such, this review discusses an animal's behavior as the integrated functional output of its evolved morphological and physiological traits. Specifically, we focus on recent findings about the blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, for which clear relationships exist between its physical traits and ecosystem. This species includes two morphotypes: an eyed surface dweller versus many conspecific types of blind cave dwellers, some of which evolved independently; all of the blind subtypes derived from eyed surface dwellers. The blind cavefish evolved under clear selection pressures: food is sparse and darkness is perpetual. Simulating the major aspects of a cave ecosystem in the laboratory is relatively easy, so we can use this species to begin resolving the relationships between evolved traits and selection pressures—relationships which are more complex for other animals models. This review discusses the recent advances in cavefish research that have helped us establish some key relationships between morphological evolution and environmental shifts.},

Electrophysiological studies revealed compromised release probability in astrocyte-specific Lrp4 knockout mice. Lrp4 mutant astrocytes suppressed glutamatergic transmission by enhancing the release of ATP, whose level was elevated in the hippocampus of Lrp4 mutant mice. Consequently, the mutant mice were impaired in locomotor activity and spatial memory and were resistant to seizure induction. These impairments could be ameliorated by blocking the adenosine A1 receptor. The results reveal a critical role for Lrp4, in response to agrin, in modulating astrocytic ATP release and synaptic transmission.

A new cell partner at NMJ has been unmasked and is challenging our understanding of the functioning of this synapse. Toxins are now used as new tools to study degeneration/regeneration. The possibility of creating human NMJ in vitro is within reach with major consequences for drug screening. Wnts are secreted neurogenic factors that have been involved in vitro in acetylcholine receptor clustering, but their precise role in vivo remains to be clarified. All these data are raising new and exciting perspectives in the field and are discussed in this Review.

abstract = {Agrin-deficient mice die at birth because of aberrant development of the neuromuscular junctions. Here, we examined the role of agrin at brain synapses. We show that agrin is associated with excitatory but not inhibitory synapses in the cerebral cortex. Most importantly, we examined the brains of agrin-deficient mice whose perinatal death was prevented by the selective expression of agrin in motor neurons. We find that the number of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations is strongly reduced in the cortex of 5- to 7-week-old mice. Consistent with a reduction in the number of synapses, the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents was greatly decreased. In accordance with the synaptic localization of agrin to excitatory synapses, changes in the frequency were only detected for excitatory but not inhibitory synapses. Moreover, we find that the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK, which is known to be an essential component of agrin-induced signaling at the neuromuscular junction, is also localized to a subset of excitatory synapses. Finally, some components of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which has been shown to be activated by agrin in cultured neurons, are deregulated in agrin-deficient mice. In summary, our results provide strong evidence that agrin plays an important role in the formation and/or the maintenance of excitatory synapses in the brain, and we provide evidence that this function involves MAP kinase signaling.},

It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation.

Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling plays a vital role in adult neurogenesis but whether it might engage DA neurogenesis/neurorepair in the affected PD brain is yet unresolved. Recently, the adult midbrain aqueduct periventricular regions (Aq-PVRs) were shown to harbor multipotent clonogenic neural stem/progenitor cells (mNPCs) with DA potential in vitro, but restrictive mechanisms in vivo are believed to limit their DA regenerative capacity. Using in vitro mNPC culture systems we herein demonstrate that aging is one most critical factor restricting mNPC neurogenic potential via dysregulation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling. Coculture paradigms between young/aged (Y/A) mNPCs and Y/A astrocytes identified glial age and a decline of glial-derived factors including Wnts as key determinants of impaired neurogenic potential, whereas Wnt activation regimens efficiently reversed the diminished proliferative, neuronal, and DA differentiation potential of A-mNPCs. Next, in vivo studies in wild (Wt) and transgenic $\beta$-catenin reporter mice uncovered Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling activation and remarkable astrocyte remodeling of Aq-PVR in response to MPTP-induced DA neuron death. Spatio-temporal analyses unveiled $\beta$-catenin signaling in predopaminergic (Nurr1(+)/TH(-)) and imperiled or rescuing DAT(+) neurons during MPTP-induced DA neuron injury and self-repair. Aging inhibited Wnt signaling, whereas $\beta$-catenin activation in situ with a specific GSK-3$\beta$ antagonist promoted a significant degree of DA neurorestoration associated with reversal of motor deficit, with implications for neurorestorative approaches in PD.},

abstract = {The characid fish species Astyanax mexicanus offers a classic comparative model for the evolution of sensory systems. Populations of this species evolved in caves and became blind while others remained in streams (i.e. surface fish) and retained a functional visual system. The flow-sensitive lateral line receptors, called superficial neuromasts, are more numerous in cavefish than in surface fish, but it is unclear whether individual neuromasts differ in sensitivity between these populations. The aims of this study were to determine whether the neuromasts in cavefish impart enhanced sensitivity relative to surface fish and to test whether this aids their ability to sense flow in the absence of visual input. Sensitivity was assessed by modeling the mechanics and hydrodynamics of a flow stimulus. This model required that we measure the dimensions of the transparent cupula of a neuromast, which was visualized with fluorescent microspheres. We found that neuromasts within the eye orbit and in the suborbital region were larger and consequently about twice as sensitive in small adult cavefish as in surface fish. Behavioral experiments found that these cavefish, but not surface fish, were attracted to a 35 Hz flow stimulus. These results support the hypothesis that the large superficial neuromasts of small cavefish aid in flow sensing. We conclude that the morphology of the lateral line could have evolved in cavefish to permit foraging in a cave environment.},

The expression of Wnt ligands and Wnt signalling components in the mature mammalian CNS suggests that this pathway might also play a part in synaptic maintenance and function. In fact, Wnts have a crucial role in synaptic physiology, as they modulate the synaptic vesicle cycle, the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors and the interaction of these receptors with scaffold proteins in postsynaptic regions. In addition, Wnts participate in adult neurogenesis and protect excitatory synaptic terminals from amyloid-beta oligomer toxicity. Here, the latest insights into the function of Wnt signalling in the adult nervous system and therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cave animals converge evolutionarily on a suite of troglomorphic traits, the best known of which are eyelessness and depigmentation. We studied 11 cave and 10 surface populations of Astyanax mexicanus in order to better understand the evolutionary origins of the cave forms, the basic genetic structuring of both cave and surface populations, and the degree to which present day migration among them affects their genetic divergence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To assess the genetic structure within populations and the relationships among them we genotyped individuals at 26 microsatellite loci. We found that surface populations are similar to one another, despite their relatively large geographic separation, whereas the cave populations are better differentiated. The cave populations we studied span the full range of the cave forms in three separate geographic regions and have at least five separate evolutionary origins. Cave populations had lower genetic diversity than surface populations, correlated with their smaller effective population sizes, probably the result of food and space limitations. Some of the cave populations receive migrants from the surface and exchange migrants with one another, especially when geographically close. This admixture results in significant heterozygote deficiencies at numerous loci due to Wahlund effects. Cave populations receiving migrants from the surface contain small numbers of individuals that are intermediate in both phenotype and genotype, affirming at least limited gene flow from the surface.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Cave populations of this species are derived from two different surface stocks denoted "old" and "new." The old stock colonized caves at least three times independently while the new stock colonized caves at least twice independently. Thus, the similar cave phenotypes found in these caves are the result of repeated convergences. These phenotypic convergences have occurred in spite of gene flow from surface populations suggesting either strong natural or sexual selection for alleles responsible for the cave phenotype in the cave environment.},

abstract = {Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a receptor tyrosine kinase, is the key player during the formation of the neuromuscular junction. Signal transduction events downstream of MuSK activation induce both pre- and postsynaptic differentiation, which, most prominently, includes the clustering of acetylcholine receptors at synaptic sites. More recently, regulated MuSK endocytosis and degradation have been implicated as crucial events for MuSK signalling activity, implicating a cross-talk between signalling and endocytosis. In the present study, we use a live imaging approach to study MuSK endocytosis. We find that MuSK is internalized via a clathrin-, dynamin-dependent pathway. MuSK is transported to Rab7-positive endosomes for degradation and recycled via Rab4- and Rab11-positive vesicles. MuSK activation by Dok7 mildly affects the localization of MuSK on the cell surface but has no effect on the rate of MuSK internalization. Interestingly, MuSK colocalizes with actin and Arf6 at the cell surface and during endosomal trafficking. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton or the proper function of Arf6 concentrates MuSK in cell protrusions. Moreover, inhibition of Arf6 or cytoskeletal rearrangements impairs acetylcholine receptor clustering and phosphorylation. These results suggest that MuSK uses both classical and nonclassical endosomal pathways that involve a variety of different components of the endosomal machinery.},

@article{Rosenzweig1993,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the temporal dimension of memory formation and storage. Is the usual two-fold separation between short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) sufficient to encompass all the phenomena of memory? The traditional view is that STM grades into LTM. Evidence for an intermediate-term memory (ITM) has been proposed by some investigators. We have used both rats and chicks to investigate the stages of memory formation. In this paper, the advantages of chicks for this type of research are briefly discussed. Using a paradigm that produces weak training, the retention function for control chicks appears to be made up of four successive components which we have interpreted as representing the memory buffer, STM, ITM, and LTM. In experiments using a variety of kinase inhibitors, we have obtained evidence that ITM and LTM depend on different classes of protein kinase activities. Agents that act on calcium/calmodulin kinase cause amnesia in the ITM range-15 to 30 min post-training. Another class of inhibitors act on one or more of the kinases PKA, PKC, or PKG and cause amnesia by 60 min post-training, so we interpret this group of inhibitors as inhibiting the formation of LTM. However, the three-stage model of memory may be over-simple. For example some agents including [Leu]enkephalin and MK801 cause amnesia 4 or more h after training. It is suggested that there is a cascade of cellular events that underlies the formation of memory; these events extend from binding of neurotransmitters to receptor molecules, to release of second messengers, through activation of protein kinases, to early intermediate genes, and protein synthesis. In the attempt to diagnose and eventually ameliorate memory disorders, it may prove useful to consider the possibility of an ITM stage in humans and to look for possible impairments of ITM in patients who suffer from memory disorders. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {De novo transcription of DNA is a fundamental requirement for the formation of long-term memory. It is required during both consolidation and reconsolidation, the posttraining and postreactivation phases that change the state of the memory from a fragile into a stable and long-lasting form. Transcription generates both mRNAs that are translated into proteins, which are necessary for the growth of new synaptic connections, as well as noncoding RNA transcripts that have regulatory or effector roles in gene expression. The result is a cascade of events that ultimately leads to structural changes in the neurons that mediate long-term memory storage. The de novo transcription, critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, is orchestrated by chromatin and epigenetic modifications. The complexity of transcription regulation, its temporal progression, and the effectors produced all contribute to the flexibility and persistence of long-term memory formation. In this article, we provide an overview of the mechanisms contributing to this transcriptional regulation underlying long-term memory formation.},

Here we identify a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) specific to skeletal muscle, which we term "MuSK" for muscle-specific kinase. MuSK is expressed at low levels in proliferating myoblasts and is induced upon differentiation and fusion. In the embryo, it is specifically expressed in early myotomes and developing muscle. MuSK is then dramatically down-regulated in mature muscle, where it remains prominent only at the neuromuscular junction; MuSK is thus the only known RTK that localizes to the neuromuscular junction. Strikingly, MuSK expression is dramatically induced throughout the adult myofiber after denervation, block of electrical activity, or physical immobilization. In humans, MuSK maps to chromosome 9g31.3-32, which overlaps with the region reported to contain the Fukuyama muscular dystrophy mutation. Identification of MuSK introduces a novel receptor-factor system that seems sure to play an important and selective role in many aspects of skeletal muscle development and function. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {The forces driving the evolutionary loss or simplification of traits such as vision and pigmentation in cave animals are still debated. Three alternative hypotheses are direct selection against the trait, genetic drift, and indirect selection due to antagonistic pleiotropy. Recent work establishes that Astyanax cavefish exhibit vibration attraction behavior (VAB), a presumed behavioral adaptation to finding food in the dark not exhibited by surface fish. Genetic analysis revealed two regions in the genome with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for both VAB and eye size. These observations were interpreted as genetic evidence that selection for VAB indirectly drove eye regression through antagonistic pleiotropy and, further, that this is a general mechanism to account for regressive evolution. These conclusions are unsupported by the data; the analysis fails to establish pleiotropy and ignores the numerous other QTL that map to, and potentially interact, in the same regions. It is likely that all three forces drive evolutionary change. We will be able to distinguish among them in individual cases only when we have identified the causative alleles and characterized their effects.},

abstract = {In many research disciplines, hypothesis tests are applied to evaluate whether findings are statistically significant or could be explained by chance. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test is among the most popular hypothesis tests in medicine and life science to analyze if two groups of samples are equally distributed. This nonparametric statistical homogeneity test is commonly applied in molecular diagnosis. Generally, the solution of the WMW test takes a high combinatorial effort for large sample cohorts containing a significant number of ties. Hence, P value is frequently approximated by a normal distribution. We developed EDISON-WMW, a new approach to calculate the exact permutation of the two-tailed unpaired WMW test without any corrections required and allowing for ties. The method relies on dynamic programing to solve the combinatorial problem of the WMW test efficiently. Beyond a straightforward implementation of the algorithm, we presented different optimization strategies and developed a parallel solution. Using our program, the exact P value for large cohorts containing more than 1000 samples with ties can be calculated within minutes. We demonstrate the performance of this novel approach on randomly-generated data, benchmark it against 13 other commonly-applied approaches and moreover evaluate molecular biomarkers for lung carcinoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We found that approximated P values were generally higher than the exact solution provided by EDISON-WMW. Importantly, the algorithm can also be applied to high-throughput omics datasets, where hundreds or thousands of features are included. To provide easy access to the multi-threaded version of EDISON-WMW, a web-based solution of our algorithm is freely available at http://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/software/wtest/.},

Here we show that MuSK is expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons, as well as in non-neuronal tissues. We also provide evidence that MuSK expression in the hippocampus is required for memory consolidation, because temporally restricted knockdown after training impairs memory retention. Hippocampal disruption of MuSK also prevents the learning-dependent induction of both cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) expression, suggesting that the role of MuSK during memory consolidation critically involves the CREB-C/EBP pathway. Furthermore, we found that MuSK also plays an important role in mediating hippocampal oscillatory activity in the theta frequency as well as in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation, two synaptic responses that correlate with memory formation. We conclude that MuSK plays an important role in brain functions, including memory formation. Therefore, its expression and role are broader than what was believed previously.},

abstract = {Microglia activation is central to the neuroinflammation associated with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly because activated microglia are often a source of proinflammatory cytokines. Despite decade-long research, the molecular cascade of proinflammatory transformation of microglia in vivo remains largely elusive. Here, we report increased $\beta$-catenin expression, a central intracellular component of WNT signaling, in microglia undergoing a proinflammatory morphogenic transformation under pathogenic conditions associated with neuroinflammation such as Alzheimer's disease. We substantiate disease-associated $\beta$-catenin signaling in microglia in vivo by showing age-dependent $\beta$-catenin accumulation in mice with Alzheimer's-like pathology (APdE9). In cultured mouse microglia expressing the WNT receptors Frizzled FZD(4,5,7,8) and LDL receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6), we find that WNT-3A can stabilize $\beta$-catenin. WNT-3A dose dependently induces LRP6 phosphorylation with downstream activation of disheveled, $\beta$-catenin stabilization, and nuclear import. Gene-expression profiling reveals that WNT-3A stimulation specifically increases the expression of proinflammatory immune response genes in microglia and exacerbates the release of de novo IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$. In summary, our data suggest that the WNT family of lipoglycoproteins can instruct proinflammatory microglia transformation and emphasize the pathogenic significance of $\beta$-catenin-signaling networks in this cell type.},

abstract = {The Mexican tetra Astyanax mexicanus has many of the favorable attributes that have made the zebrafish a model system in developmental biology. The existence of eyed surface (surface fish) and blind cave (cavefish) dwelling forms in Astyanax also provides an attractive system for studying the evolution of developmental mechanisms. The polarity of evolutionary changes and the environmental conditions leading to the cavefish phenotype are known with certainty, and several different cavefish populations have evolved constructive and regressive changes independently. The constructive changes include enhancement of the feeding apparatus (jaws, taste buds, and teeth) and the mechanosensory system of cranial neuromasts. The homeobox gene Prox 1, which is expressed in the expanded taste buds and cranial neuromasts, is one of the genes involved in the constructive changes in sensory organ development. The regressive changes include loss of pigmentation and eye degeneration. Although adult cavefish lack functional eyes, small eye primordia are formed during embryogenesis, which later arrest in development, degenerate, and sink into the orbit. Apoptosis and lens signaling to other eye parts, such as the cornea, iris, and retina, result in the arrest of eye development and ultimate optic degeneration. Accordingly, an eye with restored cornea, iris, and retinal photoreceptor cells is formed when a surface fish lens is transplanted into a cavefish optic cup, indicating that cavefish optic tissues have conserved the ability to respond to lens signaling. Genetic analysis indicates that multiple genes regulate eye degeneration, and molecular studies suggest that Pax6 may be one of the genes controlling cavefish eye degeneration. Further studies of the Astyanax system will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of developmental mechanisms in vertebrates. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), synaptogenesis requires the presence of a specific receptor : MuSK, for Muscle Specific Kinase. This receptor was thought, until recently, to be mostly present and with a function clearly demonstated at the NMJ. However, a study of MuSK in the brain showed that its knockZdown affects longZterm potentiation and memory formation and consolidation. The 19Zmembers family of Wnt proteins has been shown to be implicated a lot in neural development and memory formation. Several of the Wnt proteins are known to bind to MuSK at the NMJ through its cysteineZrich domain (CRD). Thus, we decided to study the putative effect of the deletion of the CRD of MuSK in the brain. We used mutant mice bearing that deletion (MuSK∆CRD) and assessed their behavior in terms of fear, social interaction, anxiety and memory. Here, we show that mutant mice exhibit an abnormal behavior when tested for their fear (both males and females), social interaction (males), and shortZterm memory (both males and females). Interestingly, we also observed selfZmutilation on mutant males. Therefore the CRD of MuSK seems to be involved in innate and learned behaviors. Moreover, the behavioral tests used reveal sex differences.},

abstract = {Deregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity in neurones has been postulated as a key feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. This was further supported by our recent characterization of transgenic mice that conditionally over-express GSK-3beta in hippocampal and cortical neurones. These mice, designated Tet/GSK-3beta, showed many of the biochemical and cellular aspects of AD neuropathology such as tau hyperphosphorylation and somatodendritic localization, decreased nuclear beta-catenin, neuronal death and reactive gliosis. Tet/GSK-3beta mice, however, did not show tau filament formation up to the latest tested age of 3 months at least. Here we report spatial learning deficits of Tet/GSK-3beta mice in the Morris water maze. In parallel, we also measured the increase in GSK-3 activity while further exploring the possibility of tau filament formation in aged mice. We found a significant increase in GSK-3 activity in the hippocampus of Tet/GSK-3beta mice whereas no tau fibrils could be found even in very old mice. These data reinforce the hypothesis of GSK-3 deregulation in AD pathogenesis, and suggest that Tet/GSK-3beta mice can be used as an AD model and, most remarkably, can be used to test the therapeutic potential of the selective GSK-3 inhibitors that are currently under development. Additionally, these experiments suggest that destabilization of microtubules and alteration of intracellular metabolic pathways contribute to AD pathogenesis independent of toxicity triggered by the aberrant tau deposits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a cholinergic synapse that rapidly conveys signals from motoneurons to muscle cells and exhibits a high degree of subcellular specialization characteristic of chemical synapses. NMJ formation requires agrin and its coreceptors LRP4 and MuSK. Increasing evidence indicates that Wnt signaling regulates NMJ formation in Drosophila, C. elegans and zebrafish. RESULTS In the study we systematically studied the effect of all 19 different Wnts in mammals on acetylcholine receptor (AChR) cluster formation. We identified five Wnts (Wnt9a, Wnt9b, Wnt10b, Wnt11, and Wnt16) that are able to stimulate AChR clustering, of which Wnt9a and Wnt11 are expressed abundantly in developing muscles. Using Wnt9a and Wnt11 as example, we demonstrated that Wnt induction of AChR clusters was dose-dependent and non-additive to that of agrin, suggesting that Wnts may act via similar pathways to induce AChR clusters. We provide evidence that Wnt9a and Wnt11 bind directly to the extracellular domain of MuSK, to induce MuSK dimerization and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase. In addition, Wnt-induced AChR clustering requires LRP4. CONCLUSIONS These results identify Wnts as new players in AChR cluster formation, which act in a manner that requires both MuSK and LRP4, revealing a novel function of LRP4.},

We have generated mice with a targeted disruption of the gene encoding MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase selectively localized to the postsynaptic muscle surface. Neuromuscular synapses do not form in these mice, suggesting a failure in the induction of synapse formation. Together with the results of an accompanying manuscript, our findings indicate that MuSK responds to a critical nerve-derived signal (agrin), and in turn activates signaling cascades responsible for all aspects of synapse formation, including organization of the postsynaptic membrane, synapse-specific transcription, and presynaptic differentiation.},

Astyanax mexicanus cavefish is one of the best studied cave animals; however the mechanisms underlying eye degeneration in this species are not yet completely understood. The lens seems to play a central role, but only relatively late differentiation defects have been implicated in the cavefish lens apoptosis phenotype so far. Here, we used genetic crosses between Astyanax cavefish and surface fish to confirm that during development, lens size is independent of retina size. We then investigated whether the small size of the cavefish lens could directly cause cell death. Laser ablation experiments of lens placode cells in surface fish embryos showed that a small lens size is not sufficient to trigger lens apoptosis. We further examined potential lens morphogenesis defects through classical histology and live-imaging microscopy. From lens placode to lens ball, we found that lens invagination and formation of the lens epithelium and fiber cells occur normally in cavefish. We conclude that the main and deleterious defect in the Astyanax cavefish lens must concern the molecular control of lens cell function.},

We have identified an E-box-like cis-element that is both required and sufficient for differentiation-dependent transcription. Interestingly, the promoter activity of the MuSK gene did not respond to neuregulin, a factor believed to mediate the synapse-specific transcription of acetylcholine receptor subunit genes. Rather, MuSK expression is increased in muscle cells stimulated with Wnt or at conditions when the Wnt signaling was activated.

Through different receptors, Wnts activate diverse signaling pathways that lead to local changes on the cytoskeleton or global cellular changes involving nuclear function. Recently, a link between neuronal activity, essential for the formation and refinement of neuronal connections, and Wnt signaling has been uncovered. Indeed, neuronal activity regulates the release of Wnt and the localization of their receptors. Wnts mediate synaptic structural changes induced by neuronal activity or experience. New emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction in Wnt signaling contributes to neurological disorders.

However, the ventral thalamus was essentially unaffected, although the dorsal thalamic defect leads to rostral displacement of portions of the ventral thalamus. Analysis of younger embryos showed that epithalamic and dorsal thalamic neurons were not produced at early stages of development, whereas ventral thalamic neurons were still produced. These defects were accompanied by improper formation of the boundary between dorsal and ventral thalamus, the zona limitans interthalamica (ZLI). Furthermore, the expression of an early marker of posterior forebrain development that marks the compartment from the midbrain-hindbrain junction to the ZLI (including the future dorsal thalamus, pretectum, and midbrain) was disrupted, supporting the idea that diencephalic development is abnormal from very early in embryogenesis.

In most models, every individual plays with all others, and then reproduces and dies according to what she earns. This amounts to assuming that selection takes place at a slow pace with respect to the interaction time scale. We show that, quite generally, if selection speeds up, the evolution outcome changes dramatically. Thus, in games such as Harmony, where cooperation is the only equilibrium and the only rational outcome, rapid selection leads to dominance of defectors. Similar non trivial phenomena arise in other binary games and even in more complicated settings such as the Ultimatum game. We conclude that the rate of selection is a key element to understand and model the emergence of cooperation, and one that has so far been overlooked.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Genetic factors play a major role in the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and intellectual disability (ID). The underlying genetic factors have become better understood in recent years due to advancements in next generation sequencing. These studies have uncovered a vast number of genes that are impacted by different types of mutations (e.g., de novo, missense, truncation, copy number variations). ABSTRACT Given the large volume of genetic data, analyzing each gene on its own is not a feasible approach and will take years to complete, let alone attempt to use the information to develop novel therapeutics. To make sense of independent genomic data, one approach is to determine whether multiple risk genes function in common signaling pathways that identify signaling "hubs" where risk genes converge. This approach has led to multiple pathways being implicated, such as synaptic signaling, chromatin remodeling, alternative splicing, and protein translation, among many others. In this review, we analyze recent and historical evidence indicating that multiple risk genes, including genes denoted as high-confidence and likely causal, are part of the Wingless (Wnt signaling) pathway. In the brain, Wnt signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that plays an instrumental role in developing neural circuits and adult brain function. CONCLUSIONS We will also review evidence that pharmacological therapies and genetic mouse models further identify abnormal Wnt signaling, particularly at the synapse, as being disrupted in ASDs and contributing to disease pathology.},

abstract = {The evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the loss of eyes in cave animals are still unresolved. Hypotheses invoking natural selection or neutral mutation have been advanced to explain eye regression. Here we describe comparative molecular and developmental studies in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus that shed new light on this problem. A. mexicanus is a single species consisting of a sighted surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and many blind cave-dwelling forms (cavefish) from different caves. We first review the evolutionary relationships of Astyanax cavefish populations and conclude that eye degeneration may have evolved multiple times. We then compare the mechanisms of eye degeneration in different cavefish populations. We describe the results of experiments showing that programmed cell death of the lens plays a key role in controlling eye degeneration in these cavefish populations. We also show that Pax6 gene expression and fate determination in the optic primordia are modified similarly in different cavefish populations, probably due to hyperactive midline signaling. We discuss the contributions of the comparative developmental approach toward resolving the evolutionary mechanisms of eye degeneration. A new hypothesis is presented in which both natural selection and neutral mutation are proposed to have roles in cavefish eye degeneration.},

abstract = {Neural network function can be shaped by varying the strength of synaptic connections. One way to achieve this is to vary connection structure. To investigate how structural variation among synaptic connections might affect neural computation, we examined primary afferent connections in the Drosophila olfactory system. We used large-scale serial section electron microscopy to reconstruct all the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons that target a left-right pair of glomeruli, as well as all the projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to these ORNs. We found three variations in ORN→PN connectivity. First, we found a systematic co-variation in synapse number and PN dendrite size, suggesting total synaptic conductance is tuned to postsynaptic excitability. Second, we discovered that PNs receive more synapses from ipsilateral than contralateral ORNs, providing a structural basis for odor lateralization behavior. Finally, we found evidence of imprecision in ORN→PN connections that can diminish network performance.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a tripartite synapse that is formed by motor nerve terminals, postjunctional muscle membranes, and terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) that cover the nerve-muscle contact. NMJ formation requires intimate communications among the three different components. Unlike nerve-muscle interaction, which has been well characterized, less is known about the role of SCs in NMJ formation and maintenance. We show that SCs in mice lead nerve terminals to prepatterned AChRs. Ablating SCs at E8.5 (i.e., prior nerve arrival at the clusters) had little effect on aneural AChR clusters at E13.5, suggesting that SCs may not be necessary for aneural clusters. SC ablation at E12.5, a time when phrenic nerves approach muscle fibers, resulted in smaller and fewer nerve-induced AChR clusters; however, SC ablation at E15.5 reduced AChR cluster size but had no effect on cluster density, suggesting that SCs are involved in AChR cluster maturation. Miniature endplate potential amplitude, but not frequency, was reduced when SCs were ablated at E15.5, suggesting that postsynaptic alterations may occur ahead of presynaptic deficits. Finally, ablation of SCs at P30, after NMJ maturation, led to NMJ fragmentation and neuromuscular transmission deficits. Miniature endplate potential amplitude was reduced 3 d after SC ablation, but both amplitude and frequency were reduced 6 d after. Together, these results indicate that SCs are not only required for NMJ formation, but also necessary for its maintenance; and postsynaptic function and structure appeared to be more sensitive to SC ablation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) are critical for survival and daily functioning. Defects in NMJ formation during development or maintenance in adulthood result in debilitating neuromuscular disorders. The role of Schwann cells (SCs) in NMJ formation and maintenance was not well understood. We genetically ablated SCs during development and after NMJ formation to investigate the consequences of the ablation. This study reveals a critical role of SCs in NMJ formation as well as maintenance.},

Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a secreted growth factor that influences hippocampal, striatal and neocortical pyramidal neuron dendritic spine density. However, the mechanisms by which BDNF regulates dendritic spines and how BDNF interacts with other regulators of spines remain unclear. We propose that one mechanism by which BDNF promotes dendritic spine formation is through an interaction with Wnt signaling. Here, we show that Wnt signaling inhibition in cultured cortical neurons disrupts dendritic spine development, reduces dendritic arbor size and complexity, and blocks BDNF-induced dendritic spine formation and maturation. Additionally, we show that BDNF regulates expression of Wnt2, and that Wnt2 is sufficient to promote cortical dendrite growth and dendritic spine formation. Together, these data suggest that BDNF and Wnt signaling cooperatively regulate dendritic spine formation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {Synapses are the fundamental units of neural circuits that enable complex behaviors. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a synapse formed between a motoneuron and a muscle fiber, has contributed greatly to understanding of the general principles of synaptogenesis as well as of neuromuscular disorders. NMJ formation requires neural agrin, a motoneuron-derived protein, which interacts with LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4) to activate the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase). However, little is known of how signals are transduced from agrin to MuSK. Here, we present the first crystal structure of an agrin-LRP4 complex, consisting of two agrin-LRP4 heterodimers. Formation of the initial binary complex requires the z8 loop that is specifically present in neuronal, but not muscle, agrin and that promotes the synergistic formation of the tetramer through two additional interfaces. We show that the tetrameric complex is essential for neuronal agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering. Collectively, these results provide new insight into the agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling cascade and NMJ formation and represent a novel mechanism for activation of receptor tyrosine kinases.},

Here we identify a behavioral shift and its morphological basis in Astyanax mexicanus, a teleost with a sighted surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and various blind cave-dwelling forms (cavefish) [2-4]. Vibration attraction behavior (VAB) is the ability of fish to swim toward the source of a water disturbance in darkness. VAB was typically seen in cavefish, rarely in surface fish, and was advantageous for feeding success in the dark. The potential for showing VAB has a genetic component and is linked to the mechanosensory function of the lateral line. VAB was evoked by vibration stimuli peaking at 35 Hz, blocked by lateral line inhibitors, first detected after developmental increases in superficial neuromast (SN) number and size [5-7], and significantly reduced by bilateral ablation of SN. We conclude that VAB and SN enhancement coevolved to compensate for loss of vision and to help blind cavefish find food in darkness. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All right reserved.},

abstract = {Activity-dependent modifications in synapse structure play a key role in synaptic development and plasticity, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We demonstrate that glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junctions undergo rapid changes in synaptic structure and function in response to patterned stimulation. These changes, which depend on transcription and translation, include formation of motile presynaptic filopodia, elaboration of undifferentiated varicosities, and potentiation of spontaneous release frequency. Experiments indicate that a bidirectional Wnt/Wg signaling pathway underlies these changes. Evoked activity induces Wnt1/Wg release from synaptic boutons, which stimulates both a postsynaptic DFz2 nuclear import pathway as well as a presynaptic pathway involving GSK-3$\beta$/Shaggy. Our findings suggest that bidirectional Wg signaling operates downstream of synaptic activity to induce modifications in synaptic structure and function. We propose that activation of the postsynaptic Wg pathway is required for the assembly of the postsynaptic apparatus, while activation of the presynaptic Wg pathway regulates cytoskeletal dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Reliable procedures to induce neural commitment of totipotent undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells have provided new tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying cell fate choices. We extensively characterized the developmental potential of ES-induced neural cells obtained using an adaptation of the multistep induction protocol. We provided evidence that ES-derived neural proliferating cells are endowed with stem cell properties such as extensive self-renewal capacity and single-cell multipotency. In differentiating conditions, cells matured exclusively into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. All these features have been previously described in only somatic neural stem cells (NSCs). Therefore, we consider it more appropriate to rename our cells ES-derived NSCs. These similarities between the two NSC populations induced us to carefully compare their proliferation ability and differentiation potential. Although they were very similar in overall behavior, we scored specific differences. For instance, ES-derived NSCs proliferated at higher rate and consistently generated a higher number of neurons compared with somatic NSCs. To further investigate their relationships, we carried out a molecular analysis comparing their transcriptional profiles during proliferation. We observed a large fraction of shared expressed transcripts, including genes previously described to be critical in defining somatic NSC traits. Among the genes differently expressed, candidate genes possibly responsible for divergences between the two cell types were selected and further investigated. In particular, we showed that an enhanced MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling is acting in ES-induced NSCs, probably triggered by insulin-like growth factor-II. This may contribute to the high proliferation rate exhibited by these cells in culture.},

@article{Cherubini2015,
abstract = {The hippocampus, in the temporal lobe, is phylogenetically one of the oldest parts of the brain and forms part of the limbic sys-tem. The hippocampus proper is defined by the dentate gyrus and Cornu Ammonis (CA). While the dentate gyrus contains the fas-cia dentata and the hilus, the CA is anatomically and functionally differentiated into distinct subfields named CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4. The CA3 region has attracted major attention in recent years for its specific role in memory processes, susceptibility to seizures and neuro-degeneration. Internal connectivity in the CA3 subfield is more rich than in other hippocampal regions. Recurrent axon collaterals of CA3 pyramidal cells ramify extensively making excitatory contacts with neighboring excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Lorente de N{\'{o}}, 1934). This circuit is implicated in encoding spatial rep-resentations (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978) and episodic memories (Scoville and Milner, 1957). It generates coherent population syn-chronies, including gamma, theta and sharp-waves, presumed to associate firing in selected assemblies of cells in different behav-ioral conditions (Buzs{\'{a}}ki et al., 1983). The CA3 region receives inputs from the entorhinal cortex either directly via the perforant path or indirectly from the dentate gyrus via the mossy fibers (Amaral and Witter, 1983). Mossy fiber connections made with principal or mossy cells terminate with large boutons (5–8 $\mu$m) while those with interneurons are targeted by smaller filopodial extensions. The mossy fiber pathway acts as a high-pass filter that translates densely coded cortical signals to a sparse, specific hippocampal code, essential for memory formation. This e-book aims to highlight recent advances by bringing together experts on the cellular and molecular mechanisms regu-lating the wiring properties of the CA3 hippocampal microcircuit in both physiological and pathological conditions. The seven reviews and four research articles are organized to follow neu-ronal information flowing from the dentate gyrus to the CA3 associative network. Firstly, M{\"{u}}nster-Wandowski et al. (2013) (Inst. Integrative Neuroanatomy, La Charit{\'{e}}, Berlin and Instituto Polit{\'{e}}cnico Nacional, Mexico City) review recent data showing that MF ter-minals can transiently release GABA as well as glutamate, both in early post-natal life and after periods of intense activity in adulthood. GABA and glutamate co-release from single identi-fied MF boutons has been recently demonstrated. Mossy fibers apparently form electrical synapses, as well as chemical synapses, with CA3 pyramidal cells potentially permitting a fast excitation to overcome a strong, but delayed, feed-forward inhibition. Since MF axons of dentate granule cells may be generated post-natally, Pedroni et al. (2014) (Dept. Neurosci, SISSA, Trieste and European Brain Research Inst, Rome) studied immature granule cells at P0–P3. At this age, with a clear GABAergic pheno-type, granule cells have small somata, few dendritic branches and axons often terminate as growth cones in the CA3 region. Depolarization induces either rudimentary or overshooting sodium spikes and low threshold calcium spikes. Post-synaptic CA3 pyramidal cells participate in spontaneous GDPs driven by synergistic actions of GABA and glutamate. The excitatory actions of GABA released from mossy fiber terminals may be crucial for network synchrony, suggested to refine microcircuits of the CA3 region. Radial glial cells guide migrating CA3 neurons during develop-ment. After characterizing signaling molecules and the temporal sequence of hippocampal development, Belvindrah et al. (2014) (INSERM U839, Inst. Fer {\`{a}} Moulin, Paris) review abnormalities of migration linked to human brain malformations: agenesia, lissencephaly, holoprosencephaly, polymicrogyria, heterotopia, and focal cortical dysplasia. Mutations in genes associated with neuronal migration in mouse models result in lamination defects of the CA3 area, a region especially vulnerable to stress and seizure-induced damage. This review links genetic, migration and cellular defects and multiple inherited neurological and psychiatric disorders. An overview of how CA3 neurons process afferent activ-ity from dentate granule cells is provided by Evstratova and T{\'{o}}th (2014) (Dept. Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Universit{\'{e}} Laval, Quebec City). They describe how the shape of mossy fiber ter-minals affects transmission to both CA3 pyramidal cells and interneurons. Transmission exhibits short-term plasticities over different frequencies which vary according to post-synaptic cell type. Granule cells usually fire at 0.01–0.1 Hz, but frequency can increase to 15–50 Hz or even higher when spatial information is coded. At these higher frequencies, glutamate also activates presynaptic autoreceptors, which modulate calcium signaling and release from mossy fiber terminals. These processes, including synaptic plasticity, differ at MF.},

Combining single-cell fate mapping and 3D cell tracking in the zebrafish, we describe a Tbx5a-dependent cell convergence pattern that is both asymmetric and topological within the fin-field lateral plate mesoderm during early fin bud initiation. We further demonstrate that a mesodermal Fgf24 convergence cue controlled by Tbx5a underlies this asymmetric convergent motility. Partial reduction in Tbx5a or Fgf24 levels disrupts the normal fin-field cell motility gradient and results in anteriorly biased perturbations of fin-field cell convergence and truncations in the pectoral fin skeleton, resembling aspects of the forelimb skeletal defects that define Holt-Oram Syndrome patients. This study provides a quantitative reference model for fin-field cell motility during vertebrate fin bud initiation and suggests that a pre-pattern of AP fate specification is already present in the fin-field before or during migration as perturbations to these early cell movements result in the alteration of specific fates.},

abstract = {Mechanisms determining final organ size are poorly understood. Animals undergoing regeneration or ongoing adult growth likely require sustained and robust mechanisms to achieve and maintain appropriate sizes. Planarians, well known for their ability to undergo whole-body regeneration due to pluripotent adult stem cells of the neoblast population, can reversibly scale body-size over an order of magnitude by controlling cell number. Using quantitative analysis, we show that after injury planarians perfectly restore brain:body proportion by increasing brain cell number through epimorphosis or decreasing brain cell number through tissue remodeling (morphallaxis), as appropriate. We identify a pathway controlling a brain size set-point that involves feedback inhibition between wnt11-6/wntA/wnt4a and notum, encoding conserved antagonistic signaling factors expressed at opposite brain poles. wnt11-6/wntA/wnt4a undergoes feedback inhibition through canonical Wnt signaling but likely regulates brain size in a non-canonical pathway independently of beta-catenin-1 and APC. Wnt/Notum signaling tunes numbers of differentiated brain cells in regenerative growth and tissue remodeling by influencing the abundance of brain progenitors descended from pluripotent stem cells, as opposed to regulating cell death. These results suggest that the attainment of final organ size might be accomplished by achieving a balance of positional signaling inputs that regulate the rates of tissue production.},

abstract = {Agrin signals through the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) to cluster acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This stands as the prevailing model of synapse induction by a presynaptic factor, yet the agrin-dependent MuSK signaling cascade is largely undefined. Abl1 (previously known as Abl) and the Abl1-related gene product Abl2 (previously known as Arg) define a family of tyrosine kinases that regulate actin structure and presynaptic axon guidance. Here we show that the Abl kinases are critical mediators of postsynaptic assembly downstream of agrin and MuSK. In mouse muscle, Abl kinases were localized to the postsynaptic membrane of the developing NMJ. In cultured myotubes, Abl kinase activity was required for agrin-induced AChR clustering and enhancement of MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, MuSK and Abl kinases effected reciprocal tyrosine phosphorylation and formed a complex after agrin engagement. Our findings suggest that Abl kinases provide the developing synapse with the kinase activity required for signal amplification and the intrinsic cytoskeletal regulatory capacity required for assembly and remodeling.},

For instance, Astyanax mexicanus (the blind Mexican cavefish) is thought to have repeatedly lost its eyes following colonization of cave environments, but the number of evolutionarily independent invasions of this species into caves remains unclear. Because of these repeated losses, it has become a model organism for studying the genetic basis of phenotypic trait loss. Here we reconstruct a high-resolution phylogeography for A. mexicanus inferred from both mitochondrial DNA and several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter release is mediated by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone of nerve terminals. To support rapid and repeated rounds of release, synaptic vesicles undergo a trafficking cycle. The focal point of the vesicle cycle is Ca 2+ -triggered exocytosis that is followed by different routes of endocytosis and recycling. Recycling then leads to the docking and priming of the vesicles for another round of exo-and endocytosis. Recent studies have led to a better definition than previously available of how Ca 2+ triggers exocytosis and how vesicles recycle. In particular, insight into how Munc18-1 collaborates with SNARE proteins in fusion, how the vesicular Ca 2+ sensor synaptotagmin 1 triggers fast release, and how the vesicular Rab3 protein regulates release by binding to the active zone proteins RIM1$\alpha$ and RIM2$\alpha$ has advanced our understanding of neurotransmitter release. The present review attempts to relate these molecular data with physiological results in an emerging view of nerve terminals as macromolecular machines.},

Increasing evidence suggests a role for Wnts in this process, yet how muscle cells respond to Wnt signals is unclear. Here, we show that in vivo, wnt11r and wnt4a initiate MuSK translocation from muscle membranes to recycling endosomes and that this transition is crucial for AChR accumulation at future synaptic sites. Moreover, we demonstrate that components of the planar cell polarity pathway colocalize to recycling endosomes and that this localization is MuSK dependent. Knockdown of several core components disrupts MuSK translocation to endosomes, AChR localization and axonal guidance. We propose that Wnt-induced trafficking of the MuSK receptor to endosomes initiates a signaling cascade to align pre- with postsynaptic elements. Collectively, these findings suggest a general mechanism by which Wnt signals shape synaptic connectivity through localized receptor endocytosis.},

MuSK interacts with the Wnt morphogens, through its Frizzled-like domain (cysteine-rich domain [CRD]). Dysfunction of MuSK CRD in patients has been recently associated with the onset of myasthenia, common neuromuscular disorders mainly characterized by fatigable muscle weakness. However, the physiological role of Wnt-MuSK interaction in NMJ formation and function remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the CRD deletion of MuSK in mice caused profound defects of both muscle prepatterning, the first step of NMJ formation, and synapse differentiation associated with a drastic deficit in AChR clusters and excessive growth of motor axons that bypass AChR clusters. Moreover, adult MuSK$\Delta$CRD mice developed signs of congenital myasthenia, including severe NMJs dismantlement, muscle weakness, and fatigability. We also report, for the first time, the beneficial effects of lithium chloride, a reversible inhibitor of the glycogen synthase kinase-3, that rescued NMJ defects in MuSK$\Delta$CRD mice and therefore constitutes a novel therapeutic reagent for the treatment of neuromuscular disorders linked to Wnt-MuSK signaling pathway deficiency. Together, our data reveal that MuSK CRD is critical for NMJ formation and plays an unsuspected role in NMJ maintenance in adulthood.},

Two distinct forms exist within this species: the surface-dwelling form (SF) and the cave-dwelling form (CF), which lives in total darkness with really few interactions with outside world. The cave-dwelling form presents a lack of pigmentation and is blind, due to eye degeneration during early development. An eye will however develops, but exhibits morphological modifications before disappearing. My project was to study and compare the morphogenetical regionalization of the eye between SF and CF. This study was performed using in situ hybridization targeting marker genes of different retinal regions. I found that there is a naso-temporal rotation around the lens of these regions in the cave-dwelling form. This rotation may be due to an increase of Shh expression in the early CF embryo, which could make retinal cells adopt optic stalk fate, mainly in the nasal part of the eye which seems to be more sensitive. This change of fate would push away the other regions incompatible with this fate, and would be responsible for the coloboma-like phenotype of the cavefish eye.},

In this study we used transcriptional microarray analysis to examine the expression of Wnt signaling components in the spinal cords of ALS transgenic SOD1(G93A) mice at different stages. We found that ALS onset led to the upregulation of Wnt signaling components and target genes involved in growth regulation and proliferation. We also determined the expression of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif1) and Wnt4 in the spinal cord of ALS transgenic mice at different stages by Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. The protein levels of Wif1 and Wnt4 in the spinal cords of ALS transgenic mice were upregulated compared to those in wild-type mice. Moreover, the expression of Wif1 and Wnt4 in mature GFAP+ astrocytes was increased at the end stage of ALS.

Its expression enables agrin binding and MuSK signaling in cells that otherwise do not respond to agrin. Suppression of LRP4 expression in muscle cells attenuates agrin binding, agrin-induced MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering. LRP4 also forms a complex with MuSK in a manner that is stimulated by agrin. Finally, we showed that LRP4 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in agrin-stimulated muscle cells. These observations indicate that LRP4 is a coreceptor of agrin that is necessary for MuSK signaling and AChR clustering and identify a potential target protein whose mutation and/or autoimmunization may cause muscular dystrophies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that expression of Musk is prepatterned in muscle and that early Musk expression in developing myotubes is sufficient to establish muscle prepatterning. We further show that ectopic Musk expression promotes ectopic synapse formation, indicating that muscle prepatterning normally has an instructive role in directing where synapses will form. In addition, ectopic Musk expression stimulates synapse formation in the absence of Agrin and rescues the lethality of Agrn mutant mice, demonstrating that the postsynaptic cell, and MuSK in particular, has a potent role in regulating the formation of synapses.},

abstract = {Most neurons co-express two catalytic isoforms of Na,K-ATPase, the ubiquitous $\alpha$1, and the more selectively expressed $\alpha$3. Although neurological syndromes are associated with $\alpha$3 mutations, the specific role of this isoform is not completely understood. Here, we used electrophysiological and Na(+) imaging techniques to study the role of $\alpha$3 in central nervous system neurons expressing both isoforms. Under basal conditions, selective inhibition of $\alpha$3 using a low concentration of the cardiac glycoside, ouabain, resulted in a modest increase in intracellular Na(+) concentration ([Na(+)](i)) accompanied by membrane potential depolarization. When neurons were challenged with a large rapid increase in [Na(+)](i), similar to what could be expected following suprathreshold neuronal activity, selective inhibition of $\alpha$3 almost completely abolished the capacity to restore [Na(+)](i) in soma and dendrite. Recordings of Na,K-ATPase specific current supported the notion that when [Na(+)](i) is elevated in the neuron, $\alpha$3 is the predominant isoform responsible for rapid extrusion of Na(+). Low concentrations of ouabain were also found to disrupt cortical network oscillations, providing further support for the importance of $\alpha$3 function in the central nervous system. The $\alpha$ isoforms express a well conserved protein kinase A consensus site, which is structurally associated with an Na(+) binding site. Following activation of protein kinase A, both the $\alpha$3-dependent current and restoration of dendritic [Na(+)](i) were significantly attenuated, indicating that $\alpha$3 is a target for phosphorylation and may participate in short term regulation of neuronal function.},

We report here that Wingless-type family member 5A (Wnt-5a) is expressed early in development and stimulates dendrite spine morphogenesis, inducing de novo formation of spines and increasing the size of the preexisting ones in hippocampal neurons. Wnt-5a increased intracellular calcium concentration in dendritic processes and the amplitude of NMDA spontaneous miniature currents. Acute application of Wnt-5a increased the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in hippocampal slices, an effect that was prevented by calcium-channel blockers. The physiological relevance of our findings is supported by studies showing that Wnt scavengers decreased spine density, miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, and fEPSP amplitude. We conclude that Wnt-5a stimulates different aspects of synaptic differentiation and plasticity in the mammalian central nervous system.},

Here we show that the power of hippocampal theta-associated gamma oscillations recorded during urethane anesthesia tends to be greater in rats reared in an enriched environment than those reared in an isolated condition. This experience-dependent gamma enhancement is consistently larger in the right hippocampus across subjects, coinciding with a lateralized increase of synaptic density in the right hippocampus. Moreover, interhemispheric coherence in the enriched environment group is significantly elevated at the gamma frequency. These results suggest that enriched rearing sculpts the functional left-right asymmetry of hippocampal circuits by reorganization of synapses.},

abstract = {The neuronal loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects areas of the brain that are vital to cognition. Although recent studies have shown that new neurons can be generated from progenitor cells in the neocortices of healthy adults, the neurogenic potential of the stem/progenitor cells of AD patients is not known. To answer this question, we compared the properties of glial progenitor cells (GPCs) from the cortices of healthy control (HC) and AD subjects. The GPCs from AD brain samples displayed reduced renewal capability and reduced neurogenesis compared with GPCs from HC brains. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this difference, we compared beta-catenin signaling proteins in GPCs from AD versus HC subjects and studied the effect of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta, a hallmark of AD pathology) on GPCs. Interestingly, GPCs from AD patients exhibited elevated levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta, an enzyme known to phosphorylate beta-catenin), accompanied by an increase in phosphorylated beta-catenin and a decrease in nonphosphorylated beta-catenin compared with HC counterparts. Furthermore. we found that Abeta treatment impaired the ability of GPCs from HC subjects to generate new neurons and caused changes in beta-catenin signaling proteins similar to those observed in GPCs from AD patients. Similar results were observed in GPCs isolated from AD transgenic mice. These results suggest that Abeta-induced interruption of beta-catenin signaling may contribute to the impairment of neurogenesis in AD progenitor cells.},

abstract = {Myshkin mice heterozygous for an inactivating mutation in the neuron-specific Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase $\alpha$3 isoform show behavior analogous to mania, including an abnormal endogenous circadian period. Agrin is a proteoglycan implicated as a regulator of synapses that has been proposed to inhibit activity of Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase $\alpha$3. We examined whether the mania-related behavior of Myshkin mice could be rescued by a reduction in the expression of agrin through genetic knockout. The suppression of agrin reduced hyperambulation and holeboard exploration, restored anxiety-like behavior (or reduced risk-taking behavior), improved prepulse inhibition and shortened the circadian period. Hence, agrin is important for regulating mania-like behavior and circadian rhythms. In Myshkin mice, the suppression of agrin increased brain Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase activity by 11 ± 4{\%}, whereas no effect on Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase activity was detected when agrin was suppressed in mice without the Myshkin mutation. These results introduce agrin as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of mania and other neurological disorders associated with reduced Na(+) ,K(+) -ATPase activity and neuronal hyperexcitability.},

abstract = {Ongoing neurogenesis in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) generates a substantial population of young neurons. This phenomenon is present in all species examined thus far, including humans. Although the regulation of adult neurogenesis by various physiologically relevant factors such as learning and stress has been documented, the functional contributions of the newly born neurons to hippocampal functions are not known. We investigated possible contributions of the newly born granule neurons to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal DG. In the standard hippocampal slice preparation perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), a small (10{\%}) long-term potentiation (LTP) of the evoked field potentials is seen after tetanic stimulation of the afferent medial perforant pathway (MPP). The induction of this ACSF-LTP is resistant to a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), but is completely prevented by ifenprodil, a blocker of NR2B subtype of NMDA receptors. In contrast, slices perfused with picrotoxin (PICRO), a GABA-receptor blocker, revealed a larger (40--50{\%}), APV-sensitive but ifenprodil-insensitive LTP. The ACSF-LTP required lower frequency of stimulation and fewer stimuli for its induction than the PICRO-LTP. All these characteristics of ACSF-LTP are in agreement with the properties of the putative individual new granule neurons examined previously with the use of the whole cell recording technique in a similar preparation. A causal relationship between neurogenesis and ACSF-LTP was confirmed in experiments using low dose of gamma radiation applied to the brain 3 wk prior to the electrophysiological experiments. In these experiments, the new cell proliferation was drastically reduced and ACSF-LTP was selectively blocked. We conclude that the young, adult-generated granule neurons play a significant role in synaptic plasticity in the DG. Since DG is the major source of the afferent inputs into the hippocampus, the production and the plasticity of new neurons may have an important role in the hippocampal functions such as learning and memory.},

This study compares the development of taste buds along the jaws of each morph. To determine whether cavefish have an altered onset or rate of taste bud development, we fluorescently labeled basal and receptor cells within taste buds over a developmental series. Our results show that taste bud number increases during development in both morphs. The rate of development is, however, accelerated in cavefish; a small difference in taste bud number exists at 5 dpf reaching threefold by 22 dpf. The expansion of taste buds in cavefish is, therefore, detectable after the onset of eye degeneration. This study provides important insights into the timing of taste bud expansion in cavefish as well as enhances our understanding of taste bud development in teleosts in general.},

Evolution of behavioral changes could be one of the key steps that adapt these animals to the absence of light. Astyanax mexicanus is a teleost with sighted surface dwelling (surface fish) and blind cave dwelling (cavefish) forms. Cavefish, a descendant of surface fish ancestors, have evolved a suite of constructive traits including an increase in the number and diameter of superficial neuromasts (SN). Prior to our study, no clear relationships had been established between constructive traits and the evolution of behavior. The current results link SN enhancement to vibration attraction behavior (VAB), a behavioral shift that is beneficial for feeding in a dark environment. We discuss a possible scenario in which the evolution of VAB may be a key factor in the establishment and survival of cavefish ancestors in the dark cave environment.},

abstract = {The homeodomain transcription factor Orthopedia (Otp) is essential in restricting the fate of multiple classes of secreting neurons in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus of vertebrates. However, there is little information on the intercellular factors that regulate Otp expression during development. Here, we identified two otp orthologues in zebrafish (otp1 and otp2) and explored otp1 in the context of the morphogenetic pathways that specify neuroectodermal regions. During forebrain development, otp1 is expressed in anterior groups of diencephalic cells, positioned in the preoptic area (PO) (anterior alar plate) and the posterior tuberculum (PT) (posterior basal plate). The latter structure is characterized by Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells, suggesting a role for otp1 in the lineage restriction of catecholaminergic (CA) neurons. Disruptions of Hedgehog (HH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathways point to the ability of SHH protein to trigger otp1 expression in PO presumptive neuroblasts, with the attenuating effect of Dzip1 and FGF8. In addition, our data disclose otp1 as a determinant of CA neurons in the PT, where otp1 activity is strictly dependent on Nodal signaling and it is not responsive to SHH and FGF. In this study, we pinpoint the evolutionary importance of otp1 transcription factor in cell states of the diencephalon anlage and early neuronal progenitors. Furthermore, our data indicate that morphogenetic mechanisms differentially regulate otp1 expression in alar and basal plates.},

abstract = {We investigated differentiation processes in the Neotropical fish Astyanax that represents a model system for examining adaptation to caves, including regressive evolution. In particular, we analyzed microsatellite and mitochondrial data of seven cave and seven surface populations from Mexico to test whether the evolution of the cave fish represents a case of parallel evolution. Our data revealed that Astyanax invaded northern Mexico across the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt at least three times and that populations of all three invasions adapted to subterranean habitats. Significant differentiation was found between the cave and surface populations. We did not observe gene flow between the strongly eye and pigment reduced old cave populations (Sabinos, Tinaja, Pachon) and the surface fish, even when syntopically occurring like in Yerbaniz cave. Little gene flow, if any, was found between cave populations, which are variable in eye and pigmentation (Micos, Chica, Caballo Moro caves), and surface fish. This suggests that the variability is due to their more recent origin rather than to hybridization. Finally, admixture of the young Chica cave fish population with nuclear markers from older cave fish demonstrates that gene flow between populations that independently colonized caves occurs. Thus, all criteria of parallel speciation are fulfilled. Moreover, the microsatellite data provide evidence that two co-occurring groups with small sunken eyes and externally visible eyes, respectively, differentiated within the partly lightened Caballo Moro karst window cave and might represent an example for incipient sympatric speciation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The evolution of degenerate characteristics remains a poorly understood phenomenon. Only recently has the identification of mutations underlying regressive phenotypes become accessible through the use of genetic analyses. Focusing on the Mexican cave tetra Astyanax mexicanus, we describe, here, an analysis of the brown mutation, which was first described in the literature nearly 40 years ago. This phenotype causes reduced melanin content, decreased melanophore number, and brownish eyes in convergent cave forms of A. mexicanus. Crosses demonstrate non-complementation of the brown phenotype in F(2) individuals derived from two independent cave populations: Pach{\'{o}}n and the linked Yerbaniz and Japon{\'{e}}s caves, indicating the same locus is responsible for reduced pigmentation in these fish. While the brown mutant phenotype arose prior to the fixation of albinism in Pach{\'{o}}n cave individuals, it is unclear whether the brown mutation arose before or after the fixation of albinism in the linked Yerbaniz/Japon{\'{e}}s caves. Using a QTL approach combined with sequence and functional analyses, we have discovered that two distinct genetic alterations in the coding sequence of the gene Mc1r cause reduced pigmentation associated with the brown mutant phenotype in these caves. Our analysis identifies a novel role for Mc1r in the evolution of degenerative phenotypes in blind Mexican cavefish. Further, the brown phenotype has arisen independently in geographically separate caves, mediated through different mutations of the same gene. This example of parallelism indicates that certain genes are frequent targets of mutation in the repeated evolution of regressive phenotypes in cave-adapted species.},

abstract = {The protein superfamily of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are essential components of intercellular signalling pathways necessary for normal cellular regulation. We report the cloning and developmental expression pattern of Nsk2, a novel, structurally distinct mammalian RTK characterised by a putative extracellular region bearing four immunoglobulin-like domains. The Nsk2 locus was mapped to the distal region of mouse chromosome 13 and was found to be expressed preferentially in skeletal muscle amongst adult mouse tissues. Moreover, increased steady-state levels of Nsk2 transcripts were apparent on terminal differentiation of committed skeletal myoblast cell lines in vitro and multiple isoforms of the Nsk2 RTK were identified in skeletal myotube cultures. RNA in situ hybridisation studies of mouse embryos confirmed skeletal myogenesis to be a major site of Nsk2 expression during normal embryogenesis, and identified other likely sites of Nsk2 function in ganglia of the developing peripheral nervous system and various embryonic epithelia, including those of kidney, lung and gut, during fetal development. Taken together, our data suggest normal functions for Nsk2 RTKs in distinctive aspects of skeletal muscle development, neurogenesis and mesenchymal-epithelial interactions during organ formation.},

abstract = {The sclera is the protective outer layer of the eye. In fishes, birds, and reptiles, the sclera may be reinforced with additional bony elements called scleral ossicles. Teleost fish vary in the number and size of scleral ossicles; however, the genetic mechanisms responsible for this variation remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the inheritance of scleral ossicles in the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, which exhibits both a cave morph and a surface fish morph. As these morphs and their hybrids collectively exhibit zero, one, and two scleral ossicles, they represent a microcosm of teleost scleral ossicle diversity. Our previous research in F2 hybrids of cavefish from Pach{\'{o}}n cave and surface fish from Texas suggested that three genes likely influence the formation of scleral ossicles in this group through an epistatic threshold model of inheritance, though our sample size was small. In this study, we expand our sample size using additional hybrids of Pach{\'{o}}n cavefish and Mexican surface fish to (1) confirm the threshold model of inheritance, (2) refine the number of genes responsible for scleral ossicle formation, and (3) increase our power to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for this trait. To answer these three questions, we scored surface fish and cavefish F2 hybrids for the presence of zero, one, or two scleral ossicles. We then analyzed their distribution among the F2 hybrids using a chi-square ($\chi$2) test, and used a genetic linkage map of over 100 microsatellite markers to identify QTL responsible for scleral ossicle number. We found that inheritance of scleral ossicles follows an epistatic threshold model of inheritance controlled by two genes, which contrasts the three-locus model estimated from our previous study. Finally, the combined analysis of hybrids from both crosses identified two strong QTL for scleral ossicle number on linkage groups 4.2 and 21, and a weaker QTL on linkage group 4.1. Scleral ossification remains a complex trait with limited knowledge of its genetic basis. This study provides new insight into the number and location of genes controlling the formation of scleral ossicles in a teleost fish species.},

abstract = {Wnt proteins comprise a major family of signaling molecules that orchestrate and influence a myriad of cell biological and developmental processes. Although our understanding of the role of Wnt signaling in regulating development and affecting disease, such as cancer, has been ever increasing, the study of the Wnt proteins themselves has been painstaking and slow moving. Despite advances in the biochemical characterization of Wnt proteins, many mysteries remain unsolved. In contrast to other developmental signaling molecules, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGF), transforming growth factors (TGF$\beta$), and Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnt proteins have not conformed to many standard methods of protein production, such as bacterial overexpression, and analysis, such as ligand-receptor binding assays. The reasons for their recalcitrant nature are likely a consequence of the complex set of posttranslational modifications involving several highly specialized and poorly characterized processing enzymes. With the recent description of the first Wnt protein structure, the time is ripe to uncover and possibly resolve many of the remaining issues surrounding Wnt proteins and their interactions. Here we describe the process of maturation of Wnt from its initial translation to its eventual release from a cell and interactions in the extracellular environment.},

Lrp4, together with one of its ligands Agrin and its co-receptors Muscle Specific Kinase (MuSK) and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), regulates neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation. All four proteins are also expressed in the adult brain, and APP, MuSK, and Agrin are required for normal synapse function in the CNS. Here, we show that Lrp4 is also required for normal hippocampal plasticity. In contrast to the closely related Lrp8/Apoer2, the intracellular domain of Lrp4 does not appear to be necessary for normal expression and maintenance of long-term potentiation at central synapses or for the formation and maintenance of peripheral NMJs. However, it does play a role in limb development.},

abstract = {Agrin is an extracellular matrix protein that mediates the nerve-induced clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on target muscle cells, and thus plays a key role in development of the neuromuscular synapse. Alternative exon usage within the rat agrin gene predicts numerous protein isoforms, which differ by the inclusion or exclusion of small inserts at three sites in the C-terminal half of the molecule; the insert status at two of these sites, termed Y and Z, profoundly influences the acetylcholine receptor clustering activity. We have examined the cellular expression patterns of agrin messenger RNA transcripts during rat embryogenesis by in situ hybridization with isoform-specific probes. Six 36-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed to distinguish between mRNA isoforms at either the Y site: the encoded protein contains either no insert (Y0) or a 4-amino acid insert (Y4), or the Z site: the encoded protein contains either no insert or one of 8 (Z8), 11 (Z11), or 19 (Z19) amino acids. Strikingly different expression patterns were observed for the individual Y- and Z-site encoding messages. While optional exon usage predicts the possibility of eight different agrin isoforms at the two splice sites, we detected only four isoforms in vivo: Y4Z0, Y0Z0, Y4Z8, and Y4Z19. The Y4Z0 transcript, which comprised the majority of the agrin expressed, was localized exclusively to nervous tissue and exhibited a distribution profile suggestive of a potential role in neurogenesis and/or neural differentiation. From embryonic day 13 to birth, Y4Z0 was found in mitotic ventricular zones, spinal, cranial, and sympathetic ganglia, and diffusely throughout the brain. In contrast, Y0Z0 was not expressed in neurons, but specifically labeled capillary endothelial cells within the developing nervous system. Y4Z8 and Y4Z19, the forms most active in acetylcholine receptor aggregation, were expressed at low levels only in spinal and brainstem motor neurons; Z19 expression declined from embryonic day 15 to adulthood, whereas Z8 expression increased slightly during this period. Transcripts encoding the Z11 insert could not be detected. These data suggest potential novel biological roles for agrin beyond that originally proposed in synapse formation.},

abstract = {Embryonic neurodevelopment involves inhibition of proliferation of multipotent neural stem cells followed by differentiation into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to form the brain. We have identified a new neurotrophic factor, NF-$\alpha$1, which inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation of neural stem cell/progenitors derived from E13.5 mouse cortex. Inhibition of proliferation of these cells was mediated through negatively regulating the Wnt pathway and decreasing $\beta$-catenin. NF-$\alpha$1 induced differentiation of neural stem cells to astrocytes by enhancing Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) expression through activating the ERK1/2-Sox9 signaling pathway. Cultured E13.5 cortical stem cells from NF-$\alpha$1-knockout mice showed decreased astrocyte numbers compared to wild-type mice, which was rescued by treatment with NF-$\alpha$1. In vivo, immunocytochemistry of brain sections and western blot analysis of neocortex of mice showed a gradual increase of NF-$\alpha$1 expression from E14.5 to P1 and a surge of GFAP expression at P1, the time of increase in astrogenesis. Importantly, NF-$\alpha$1-KO mice showed ∼49{\%} fewer GFAP positive astrocytes in the neocortex compared to WT mice at P1. Thus, NF-$\alpha$1 is critical for regulating anti-proliferation and cell fate determination, through differentiating embryonic stem cells to GFAP-positive astrocytes for normal neurodevelopment.

abstract = {During embryonic development, pattern formation must be tightly synchronized with tissue morphogenesis to coordinate the establishment of the spatial identities of cells with their movements. In the vertebrate retina, patterning along the dorsal-ventral and nasal-temporal (anterior-posterior) axes is required for correct spatial representation in the retinotectal map. However, it is unknown how specification of axial cell positions in the retina occurs during the complex process of early eye morphogenesis. Studying zebrafish embryos, we show that morphogenetic tissue rearrangements during eye evagination result in progenitor cells in the nasal half of the retina primordium being brought into proximity to the sources of three fibroblast growth factors, Fgf8/3/24, outside the eye. Triple-mutant analysis shows that this combined Fgf signal fully controls nasal retina identity by regulating the nasal transcription factor Foxg1. Surprisingly, nasal-temporal axis specification occurs very early along the dorsal-ventral axis of the evaginating eye. By in vivo imaging GFP-tagged retinal progenitor cells, we find that subsequent eye morphogenesis requires gradual tissue compaction in the nasal half and directed cell movements into the temporal half of the retina. Balancing these processes drives the progressive alignment of the nasal-temporal retina axis with the anterior-posterior body axis and is controlled by a feed-forward effect of Fgf signaling on Foxg1-mediated cell cohesion. Thus, the mechanistic coupling and dynamic synchronization of tissue patterning with morphogenetic cell behavior through Fgf signaling leads to the graded allocation of cell positional identity in the eye, underlying retinotectal map formation.},

abstract = {We have compared Pax6 expression during embryonic development in the eyed surface form (surface fish) and several different eyeless cave forms (cavefish) of the teleost Astyanax mexicanus. Despite lacking functional eyes as adults, cavefish embryos form small optic primordia, which later arrest in development and show various degrees of eye degeneration. The pattern of Pax6 mRNA expression was modified early and late during cavefish development. In early surface fish embryos, two bilateral Pax6 expression domains are present in the anterior neural plate, which extend across the midline and fuse to form the forebrain and optic primordia. In cavefish embryos, these Pax6 domains are diminished in size and remain separated, resulting in an anterior gap in Pax6 expression and presumably the formation of smaller optic primordia. The anterior gap in Pax6 expression was confirmed by double staining for Pax6 and distalless-3 mRNA, which marks the anterior margin of the neural plate and is unaltered in cavefish. Similar anterior gaps in Pax6 expression occurred in independently derived cavefish populations, suggesting that they are important in eye degeneration. Later during surface fish development, Pax6 protein is expressed in the cornea, lens, and ganglion and amacrine cells of the neural retina. Pax6 expression was gradually reduced during cavefish lens development, concomitant with lens arrest and degeneration, and was absent in the corneal epithelium, which does not differentiate in cavefish. In contrast, Pax6 expression in the retinal ganglion and amarcine cells is unmodified in cavefish, despite retarded retinal development. The results suggest that changes in Pax6 expression are involved in the evolution of cavefish eye degeneration.},

BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) is an inbred mouse strain that shows robust behavioral phenotypes with analogies to all three of the diagnostic symptoms of autism, including well-replicated deficits in reciprocal social interactions and social approach, unusual patterns of ultrasonic vocalization, and high levels of repetitive self-grooming. These phenotypes offer straightforward behavioral assays for translational investigations of pharmacological compounds. Two suggested treatments for autism were evaluated in the BTBR mouse model. Methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP), an antagonist of the mGluR5 metabotropic glutamate receptor, blocks aberrant phenotypes in the Fmr1 mouse model of Fragile X, a comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder with autistic features. Risperidone has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of irritability, tantrums, and self-injurious behavior in autistic individuals. We evaluated the actions of MPEP and risperidone on two BTBR phenotypes, low sociability and high repetitive self-grooming. Open field activity served as an independent control for non-social exploratory activity and motor functions. C57BL/6J (B6), an inbred strain with high sociability and low self-grooming, served as the strain control. MPEP significantly reduced repetitive self-grooming in BTBR, at doses that had no sedating effects on open field activity. Risperidone reduced repetitive self-grooming in BTBR, but only at doses that induced sedation in both strains. No overall improvements in sociability were detected in BTBR after treatment with either MPEP or risperidone. Our findings suggest that antagonists of mGluR5 receptors may have selective therapeutic efficacy in treating repetitive behaviors in autism.},

abstract = {The cavefish morph of the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) is blind at adult stage, although an eye that includes a retina and a lens develops during embryogenesis. There are, however, two major defects in cavefish eye development. One is lens apoptosis, a phenomenon that is indirectly linked to the expansion of ventral midline sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression during gastrulation and that induces eye degeneration. The other is the lack of the ventral quadrant of the retina. Here, we show that such ventralisation is not extended to the entire forebrain because fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8), which is expressed in the forebrain rostral signalling centre, is activated 2 hours earlier in cavefish embryos than in their surface fish counterparts, in response to stronger Shh signalling in cavefish. We also show that neural plate patterning and morphogenesis are modified in cavefish, as assessed by Lhx2 and Lhx9 expression. Inhibition of Fgf receptor signalling in cavefish with SU5402 during gastrulation/early neurulation mimics the typical surface fish phenotype for both Shh and Lhx2/9 gene expression. Fate-mapping experiments show that posterior medial cells of the anterior neural plate, which lack Lhx2 expression in cavefish, contribute to the ventral quadrant of the retina in surface fish, whereas they contribute to the hypothalamus in cavefish. Furthermore, when Lhx2 expression is rescued in cavefish after SU5402 treatment, the ventral quadrant of the retina is also rescued. We propose that increased Shh signalling in cavefish causes earlier Fgf8 expression, a crucial heterochrony that is responsible for Lhx2 expression and retina morphogenesis defect.},

abstract = {The type I receptor-like protein tyrosine kinase MuSK is essential for the neuromuscular junction formation. MuSK expression is tightly regulated during development, but the underlying mechanisms were unclear. Here we identified a novel mechanism by which MuSK expression may be regulated. A cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-like element in the 5'-flanking region of the MuSK gene binds to CREB1 (CRE-binding protein 1). Mutation of this element increases the MuSK promoter activity, suggesting a role for CREB1 in attenuation of MuSK expression. Interestingly, CREB mutants unable to bind to DNA also inhibit MuSK promoter activity, suggesting a CRE-independent inhibitory mechanism. In agreement, CREB1 could inhibit a mutant MuSK transgene reporter whose CRE site was mutated. We provide evidence that CREB interacts directly with MyoD, a myogenic factor essential for MuSK expression in muscle cells. Suppression of CREB expression by small interfering RNA increases MuSK promoter activity. These results demonstrate an important role for CREB1 in the regulation of MuSK expression.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation requires the highly coordinated communication of several reciprocal signaling processes between motoneurons and their muscle targets. Identification of the early, spatially restricted cues in target recognition at the NMJ is still poorly documented, especially in mammals. Wnt signaling is one of the key pathways regulating synaptic connectivity. Here, we report that Wnt4 contributes to the formation of vertebrate NMJ in vivo. Results from a microarray screen and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrate that Wnt4 expression is regulated during muscle cell differentiation in vitro and muscle development in vivo, being highly expressed when the first synaptic contacts are formed and subsequently downregulated. Analysis of the mouse Wnt4⁻/⁻ NMJ phenotype reveals profound innervation defects including motor axons overgrowing and bypassing AChR aggregates with 30{\%} of AChR clusters being unapposed by nerve terminals. In addition, loss of Wnt4 function results in a 35{\%} decrease of the number of prepatterned AChR clusters while Wnt4 overexpression in cultured myotubes increases the number of AChR clusters demonstrating that Wnt4 directly affects postsynaptic differentiation. In contrast, muscle structure and the localization of several synaptic proteins including acetylcholinesterase, MuSK and rapsyn are not perturbed in the Wnt4 mutant. Finally, we identify MuSK as a Wnt4 receptor. Wnt4 not only interacts with MuSK ectodomain but also mediates MuSK activation. Taken together our data reveal a new role for Wnt4 in mammalian NMJ formation that could be mediated by MuSK, a key receptor in synaptogenesis.},

abstract = {The lens influences retinal growth and differentiation during vertebrate eye development but the mechanisms are not understood. The role of the lens in retinal growth and development was studied in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, which has eyed surface-dwelling (surface fish) and blind cave-dwelling (cavefish) forms. A lens and laminated retina initially develop in cavefish embryos, but the lens dies by apoptosis. The cavefish retina is subsequently disorganized, apoptotic cells appear, the photoreceptor layer degenerates, and retinal growth is arrested. We show here by PCNA, BrdU, and TUNEL labeling that cell proliferation continues in the adult cavefish retina but the newly born cells are removed by apoptosis. Surface fish to cavefish lens transplantation, which restores retinal growth and rod cell differentiation, abolished apoptosis in the retina but not in the RPE. Surface fish lens deletion did not cause apoptosis in the surface fish retina or affect RPE differentiation. Neither lens transplantation in cavefish nor lens deletion in surface fish affected retinal cell proliferation. We conclude that the lens acts in concert with another optic component, possibly the RPE, to promote retinal cell survival. Accordingly, deficiency in both optic structures may lead to eye degeneration in cavefish. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The earliest known determinants of retinal nasotemporal identity are the transcriptional regulators Foxg1, which is expressed in the prospective nasal optic vesicle, and Foxd1, which is expressed in the prospective temporal optic vesicle. Previous work has shown that, in zebrafish, Fgf signals from the dorsal forebrain and olfactory primordia are required to specify nasal identity in the dorsal, prospective nasal, optic vesicle. Here, we show that Hh signalling from the ventral forebrain is required for specification of temporal identity in the ventral optic vesicle and is sufficient to induce temporal character when activated in the prospective nasal retina. Consequently, the evaginating optic vesicles become partitioned into prospective nasal and temporal domains by the opposing actions of Fgfs and Shh emanating from dorsal and ventral domains of the forebrain primordium. In absence of Fgf activity, foxd1 expression is established irrespective of levels of Hh signalling, indicating that the role of Shh in promoting foxd1 expression is only required in the presence of Fgf activity. Once the spatially complementary expression of foxd1 and foxg1 is established, the boundary between expression domains is maintained by mutual repression between Foxd1 and Foxg1.},

abstract = {Neuroinflammatory processes are recognized key contributory factors in Parkinson's disease (PD) physiopathology. While the causes responsible for the progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal cell bodies in the subtantia nigra pars compacta are poorly understood, aging, genetics, environmental toxicity, and particularly inflammation, represent prominent etiological factors in PD development. Especially, reactive astrocytes, microglial cells, and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages play dual beneficial/harmful effects, via a panel of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, neurotrophic and neurogenic transcription factors. Notably, with age, microglia may adopt a potent neurotoxic, pro-inflammatory “primed” (M1) phenotype when challenged with inflammatory or neurotoxic stimuli that hamper brain's own restorative potential and inhibit endogenous neurorepair mechanisms. In the last decade we have provided evidence for a major role of microglial crosstalk with astrocytes, mDA neurons and neural stem progenitor cells (NSCs) in the MPTP- (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-) mouse model of PD, and identified Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling, a pivotal morphogen for mDA neurodevelopment, neuroprotection, and neuroinflammatory modulation, as a critical actor in glia-neuron and glia-NSCs crosstalk. With age however, Wnt signalling and glia-NSC-neuron crosstalk become dysfunctional with harmful consequences for mDA neuron plasticity and repair. These findings are of importance given the deregulation of Wnt signalling in PD and the emerging link between most PD related genes, Wnt signalling and inflammation. Especially, in light of the expanding field of microRNAs and inflammatory PD-related genes as modulators of microglial-proinflammatory status, uncovering the complex molecular circuitry linking PD and neuroinflammation will permit the identification of new druggable targets for the cure of the disease. Here we summarize recent findings unveiling major microglial inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways converging in the regulation of Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signalling, and reciprocally, the ability of Wnt signalling pathways to modulate microglial activation in PD. Unravelling the key factors and conditons promoting the switch of the proinflammatory M1 microglia status into a neuroprotective and regenerative M2 phenotype will have important consequences for neuroimmune interactions and neuronal outcome under inflammatory and/or neurodegenerative conditions.},

Here, we identify Wnt5a, a member of the Wnt family of secreted morphogens, as an essential factor in maintaining dendritic architecture in the adult hippocampus and for related cognitive functions in mice. Wnt5a expression in hippocampal neurons begins postnatally, and its deletion attenuated CaMKII and Rac1 activity, reduced GluN1 glutamate receptor expression, and impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial learning and memory in 3-mo-old mice. With increased age, Wnt5a loss caused progressive attrition of dendrite arbors and spines in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 pyramidal neurons and exacerbated behavioral defects. Wnt5a functions cell-autonomously to maintain CA1 dendrites, and exogenous Wnt5a expression corrected structural anomalies even at late-adult stages. These findings reveal a maintenance factor in the adult brain, and highlight a trophic pathway that can be targeted to ameliorate dendrite loss in pathological conditions.},

abstract = {GABA(A) receptors are located on the majority of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system, where they mediate important actions of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Early in development the trophic properties of GABA allow a healthy development of the nervous system. Most neurons have a high intracellular Cl-concentration early in life due to the late functional expression of the Cl-pump KCC2, therefore GABA has excitatory effects at this stage. Upon higher expression and activation of KCC2 GABA takes on its inhibitory effects while glutamate functions as the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Like all multisubunit membrane proteins the GABA(A) receptor is assembled in the ER and travels through the Golgi and remaining secretory pathway to the cell surface, where it mediates GABA actions either directly at the synapses or at extrasynaptic sites responding to ambient GABA to provide a basal tonic inhibitory state. In order to adapt to changing needs and information states, the GABAergic system is highly dynamic. That includes subtype specific trafficking to different locations in the cell, regulation of mobility by interaction with scaffold molecules, posttranslational modifications, that either directly affect channel function or the interaction with other proteins and finally the dynamic exchange between surface and intracellular receptor pools, that either prepare receptors for recycling to the surface or degradation. Here we give an overview of the current understanding of GABA(A) receptor functional and molecular dynamics that play a major part in maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition and in changes in network activity.},

abstract = {Traditionally, brain and behavior evolution was viewed as an anagenetic process that occurred in successive stages of increasing complexity and advancement. Fishes, considered the most primitive vertebrates, were supposed to have a scarcely differentiated telencephalon, and limited learning capabilities. However, recent developmental, neuroanatomical, and functional data indicate that the evolution of brain and behavior may have been more conservative than previously thought. Experimental data suggest that the properties and neural basis of learning and memory are notably similar among teleost fish and land vertebrates. For example, lesion studies show that the teleost cerebellum is essential in classical conditioning of discrete motor responses. The lateral telencephalic pallium of the teleost fish, proposed as homologous to the hippocampus, is selectively involved in spatial learning and memory, and in trace classical conditioning. In contrast, the medial pallium, considered homologous to the amygdala, is involved in emotional conditioning in teleost fish. The data reviewed here show a remarkable parallelism between mammals and teleost fish concerning the role of different brain centers in learning and memory and cognitive processes. These evidences suggest that these separate memory systems could have appeared early during the evolution of vertebrates, having been conserved through phylogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cave-dwelling animals evolve various traits as a consequence of life in darkness. Constructive traits (e.g., enhanced non-visual sensory systems) presumably arise under strong selective pressures. The mechanism(s) driving regression of features, however, are not well understood. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses in Astyanax mexicanus Pach{\'{o}}n cave x surface hybrids revealed phenotypic effects associated with vision and pigmentation loss. Vision QTL were uniformly associated with reductions in the homozygous cave condition, however pigmentation QTL demonstrated mixed phenotypic effects. This implied pigmentation might be lost through both selective and neutral forces. Alternatively, in this report, we examined if a pleiotropic interaction may exist between vision and pigmentation since vision loss has been shown to result in darker skin in other fish and amphibian model systems. RESULTS We discovered that certain members of Pach{\'{o}}n x surface pedigrees are significantly darker than surface-dwelling fish. All of these "hypermelanic" individuals demonstrated severe visual system malformations suggesting they may be blind. A vision-mediated behavioral assay revealed that these fish, in stark contrast to surface fish, behaved the same as blind cavefish. Further, hypermelanic melanophores were larger and more dendritic in morphology compared to surface fish melanophores. However, hypermelanic melanophores responded normally to melanin-concentrating hormone suggesting darkening stemmed from vision loss, rather than a defect in pigment cell function. Finally, a number of genomic regions were coordinately associated with both reduced vision and increased pigmentation. CONCLUSIONS This work suggests hypermelanism in hybrid Astyanax results from blindness. This finding provides an alternative explanation for phenotypic effect studies of pigmentation QTL as stemming (at least in part) from environmental, rather than exclusively genetic, interactions between two regressive phenotypes. Further, this analysis reveals persistence of background adaptation in Astyanax. As the eye was lost in cave-dwelling forms, enhanced pigmentation resulted. Given the extreme cave environment, which is often devoid of nutrition, enhanced pigmentation may impose an energetic cost. Such an energetic cost would be selected against, as a means of energy conservation. Thus, the pleiotropic interaction between vision loss and pigmentation may reveal an additional selective pressure favoring the loss of pigmentation in cave-dwelling animals.},

A critical question raised by these studies is whether different induction pathways either converge onto a common molecular mechanism or engage different molecular cascades for the maintenance of long-term plasticity. We directly examined this issue in the context of memory for sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia. In this system, training with a single tail shock normally induces short-term memory ({\textless}30 min) for sensitization of tail-elicited siphon withdrawal, whereas repeated spaced shocks induce both intermediate-term memory (ITM) ({\textgreater}90 min) and long-term memory ({\textgreater}24 hr). We now show that a single tail shock can also induce ITM that is expressed selectively at the trained site (site-specific ITM). Although phenotypically similar to the form of ITM induced by repeated trials, the mechanisms by which site-specific ITM is induced and maintained are distinct. Unlike repeated-trial ITM, site-specific ITM requires neither protein synthesis nor PKA activity for induction or maintenance. Rather, the induction of site-specific ITM requires calpain-dependent proteolysis of activated PKC, yielding a persistently active PKC catalytic fragment (PKM) that also serves to maintain the memory in the intermediateterm temporal domain. Thus, two unique forms of ITM that have different induction requirements also use distinct molecular mechanisms for their maintenance.},

abstract = {Neuromuscular synapse formation depends upon coordinated interactions between motor neurons and muscle fibers, leading to the formation of a highly specialized postsynaptic membrane and a highly differentiated nerve terminal. Synapse formation begins as motor axons approach muscles that are prepatterned in the prospective synaptic region in a manner that depends upon Lrp4, a member of the LDL receptor family, and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a receptor tyrosine kinase. Motor axons supply Agrin, which binds Lrp4 and stimulates further MuSK phosphorylation, stabilizing nascent synapses. How Agrin binds Lrp4 and stimulates MuSK kinase activity is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Agrin binds to the N-terminal region of Lrp4, including a subset of the LDLa repeats and the first of four $\beta$-propeller domains, which promotes association between Lrp4 and MuSK and stimulates MuSK kinase activity. In addition, we show that Agrin stimulates the formation of a functional complex between Lrp4 and MuSK on the surface of myotubes in the absence of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Lrp4. Further, we demonstrate that the first Ig-like domain in MuSK, which shares homology with the NGF-binding region in Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase (TrKA), is required for MuSK to bind Lrp4. These findings suggest that Lrp4 is a cis-acting ligand for MuSK, whereas Agrin functions as an allosteric and paracrine regulator to promote association between Lrp4 and MuSK.},

abstract = {The fish Astyanax mexicanus presents, within the same species, populations of river-dwelling sur-face fish (SF) and blind cave-living fish. In cavefish (CF), the eyes develop almost normally during embryogenesis. But 40 h after fertilization, the lens enters apoptosis, trig-gering the progressive degeneration of the entire eye. Before apoptosis, the CF lens expresses early differentia-tion factors correctly. Here, we searched for possible late differentiation defects that would be causal in CF lens degeneration. We reasoned that crystallins, the major lens structural proteins, could be defective or misregulated. We surveyed the CF and SF transcriptomes and uncov-ered 14 Astyanax crystallins from the beta, gamma, lambda, mu, and zeta families. These proteins are less pol-ymorphic and accumulate more fixed mutations, some at highly conserved positions, in CF than in SF, suggesting relaxed selection at these loci in CF. In situ hybridizations and qPCR show that crybb1c, crybgx, crygm5 are expressed at much lower levels or are not expressed in the CF lens. For the best crystallin candidates, we tested a potential causal role in CF lens apoptosis. Crybgx, crybb1c (not expressed in CF from very early on), and cryaa (previ-ously shown to be faintly expressed in CF) failed to induce any defect when knocked-down in zebrafish embryos. However, the anti-apoptotic cryaa protected lens cells from apoptosis when reexpressed by transgenesis in CF, suggesting a cell-autonomous effect of cryaa on lens cell survival. Altogether, these data suggest that crystallin sequence evolution and expression defects may contribute to the loss of eyes in CF.},

In CF, the origin of changes in complex motivated behaviours (social, feeding, sleeping, exploratory) is unknown. Here we find a hyper-aminergic phenotype in CF brains, including high levels and neurotransmission indexes for serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline, and low monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. Although MAO expression is unchanged in CF, a pro106leu mutation is identified in the MAO coding sequence. This mutation is responsible for low MAO activity and high serotonin neurotransmission index in CF brains. We find the same mutated allele in several natural CF populations, some being independently evolved. Such occurrence of the same allele in several caves may suggest that low MAO activity is advantageous for cave life. These results provide a genetic basis for several aspects of the cavefish 'behavioural syndrome'.},

The distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR2B subunits in the apical and basal synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons is asymmetrical if the input arrives from the left or right CA3 pyramidal neurons. In the present study, we examined the role of hippocampal asymmetry in cognitive function using $\beta$2-microglobulin knock-out ($\beta$2m KO) mice, which lack hippocampal asymmetry. We tested $\beta$2m KO mice in a series of spatial and non-spatial learning tasks and compared the performances of $\beta$2m KO and C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice. The $\beta$2m KO mice appeared normal in both spatial reference memory and spatial working memory tasks but they took more time than WT mice in learning the two non-spatial learning tasks (i.e., a differential reinforcement of lower rates of behavior (DRL) task and a straight runway task). The $\beta$2m KO mice also showed less precision in their response timing in the DRL task and showed weaker spontaneous recovery during extinction in the straight runway task. These results indicate that hippocampal asymmetry is important for certain characteristics of non-spatial learning.},

abstract = {We have cloned and characterized five distinct mouse cDNAs encoding isoforms of MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase required for the development of the neuromuscular synapse. Comparison of the cDNA sequences with each other and with the mouse genomic sequence revealed that the cDNAs differ by the presence or absence of three alternatively spliced exons encoding an additional 10, 15 and 8 amino acids respectively. The location and sequences of these exons are conserved in MuSK cDNAs from different species. Examination of mouse genomic sequences revealed that the 15 aa exon sequence is present in a 52 bp exon with a non-canonical 3′ splice acceptor site at its 5′ end and an internal 3′ splice acceptor site consensus 45 bp downstream. Transcripts containing each of the alternatively spliced exons were detected in neonatal and adult mouse muscle, as well as in C2 myotubes. The presence of transcripts encoding MuSK isoforms with distinct extracellular domains in developing mouse muscle suggests that alternative splicing could potentially introduce additional complexity to the activity of MuSK in muscle.},

Pyramidal neurons are not all identical, but some shared functional principles can be identified.

These fish are currently being used to better understand a number of issues related to human health, including age-related blindness, sleep, obesity, mood-related disorders, and aging. The recent sequencing of the cavefish genome broadens the interest of this system to groups working with diverse biological systems, and has helped researchers identify genes that regulate sleep, eye degeneration, and metabolic function. Mexican cavefish are particularly powerful for the study of biological processes because these fish evolved independently in twenty-nine caves in the Sierra de el Abra Region of Northeast Mexico. These fish have dramatic adaptations to the cave environment, and this can be used to identify genes involved in disease-related traits. This scholarly text will be of interest to researchers and students throughout diverse areas of biology and ecology.

In recent years, a distinct intermediate phase of synaptic facilitation (ITF) has been described at SN-MN synapses. Here, we identify a novel intermediate phase of behavioral memory (ITM) for sensitization in Aplysia and demonstrate that it shares the temporal and mechanistic features of ITF in the intact CNS: (1) it declines completely prior to the onset of LTM, (2) its induction requires protein but not RNA synthesis, and (3) its expression requires the persistent activation of protein kinase A. Thus, in Aplysia, the same temporal and molecular characteristics that distinguish ITF from other phases of synaptic plasticity distinguish ITM from other phases of behavioral memory.},

abstract = {Axial eye patterning determines the positional code of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which is crucial for their topographic projection to the midbrain. Several asymmetrically expressed determinants of retinal patterning are known, but it is unclear how axial polarity is first established. We find that Fgf signals, including Fgf8, determine retinal patterning along the nasotemporal (NT) axis during early zebrafish embryogenesis: Fgf8 induces nasal and/or suppresses temporal retinal cell fates; and inhibition of all Fgf-receptor signaling leads to complete retinal temporalization and concomitant loss of all nasal fates. Misprojections of RGCs with Fgf-dependent alterations in retinal patterning to the midbrain demonstrate the importance of this early patterning process for late topographic map formation. The crucial period of Fgf-dependent patterning is at the onset of eye morphogenesis. Fgf8 expression, the restricted temporal requirement for Fgf-receptor signaling and target gene expression at this stage suggests that the telencephalic primordium is the source of Fgf8 and acts as novel signaling center for non-autonomous axial patterning of the prospective neural retina.},

In this process, synaptogenic factors are necessary to modulate pre- and postsynaptic differentiation. In mammals, different Wnt ligands operate through canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways, and their precise functions to coordinate synapse structure and function in the mature central nervous system are still largely unknown. Here, we studied the effect of different Wnt ligands on postsynaptic organization. We found that Wnt-5a induces short term changes in the clustering of PSD-95, without affecting its total levels. Wnt-5a promotes the recruitment of PSD-95 from a diffuse dendritic cytoplasmic pool to form new PSD-95 clusters in dendritic spines. Moreover, Wnt-5a acting as a non-canonical ligand regulates PSD-95 distribution through a JNK-dependent signaling pathway, as demonstrated by using the TAT-TI-JIP peptide in mature hippocampal neurons. Finally, using adult rat hippocampal slices, we found that Wnt-5a modulates glutamatergic synaptic transmission through a postsynaptic mechanism. Our studies indicate that the Wnt-5a/JNK pathway modulates the postsynaptic region of mammalian synapse directing the clustering and distribution of the physiologically relevant scaffold protein, PSD-95.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wnt proteins are a large family of molecules that are critically involved in multiple central nervous system (CNS) developmental processes. Experimental evidences suggest a role for this family of proteins in many CNS disorders, including spinal cord injury (SCI), which is a major neuropathology owing to its high prevalence and chronic sensorimotor functional sequelae. Interestingly, most Wnt proteins and their inhibitors are expressed in the uninjured spinal cord, and their temporal expression patterns are dramatically altered after injury. However, little is known regarding the expression of their better-known receptors, the Frizzled family, after SCI. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of Frizzled receptors in the damaged spinal cord. FINDINGS: Based on the evidence that Wnts are expressed in the spinal cord and are transcriptionally regulated by SCI in adulthood, we analysed the spatio-temporal mRNA and protein expression patterns of Frizzled receptors after contusive SCI using quantitative RT-PCR and single and double immunohistochemistry, respectively. Our results show that almost all of the 10 known Frizzled receptors were expressed in specific spatial patterns in the uninjured spinal cords. Moreover, the Frizzled mRNAs and proteins were expressed after SCI, although their expression patterns were altered during the temporal progression of SCI. Finally, analysis of cellular Frizzled 5 expression pattern by double immunohistochemistry showed that, in the uninjured spinal cord, this receptor was expressed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia and NG2(+) glial precursors. After injury, Frizzled 5 was not only still expressed in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and NG2(+) glial precursors but also in axons at all evaluated time points. Moreover, Frizzled 5 was expressed in reactive microglia/macrophages from 3 to 14 days post-injury. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the involvement of Frizzled receptors in physiological spinal cord function and in the cellular and molecular events that characterise its neuropathology.},

abstract = {Wnt signaling controls a variety of developmental and homeostatic events. As a key component of Wnt signaling, Dishevelled (Dvl/Dsh) protein relays Wnt signals from receptors to downstream effectors. In the canonical Wnt pathway that depends on the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, Dvl is recruited by the receptor Frizzled and prevents the constitutive destruction of cytosolic beta-catenin. In the non-canonical Wnt pathways such as Wnt-Frizzled/PCP (planar cell polarity) signaling, Dvl signals via the Daam1-RhoA axis and the Rac1 axis. In addition, Dvl plays important roles in Wnt-GSK3beta-microtubule signaling, Wnt-calcium signaling, Wnt-RYK signaling, Wnt-atypical PKC signaling, etc. Dvl also functions to mediate receptor endocytosis. To fulfill its multifaceted functions, it is not surprising that Dvl associates with various kinds of proteins. Its activity is also modulated dynamically by phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of Dvl functions in Wnt signal transduction and its biological functions in mouse development, and also discuss the molecular mechanisms of its actions.},

abstract = {Treating neuropathic pain is a major clinical challenge, and the underlying mechanisms of neuropathic pain remain elusive. We hypothesized that neuropathic pain-inducing nerve injury may elicit neuronal alterations that recapitulate events that occur during development. Here, we report that WNT signaling, which is important in developmental processes of the nervous system, plays a critical role in neuropathic pain after sciatic nerve injury and bone cancer in rodents. Nerve injury and bone cancer caused a rapid-onset and long-lasting expression of WNTs, as well as activation of WNT/frizzled/$\beta$-catenin signaling in the primary sensory neurons, the spinal dorsal horn neurons, and astrocytes. Spinal blockade of WNT signaling pathways inhibited the production and persistence of neuropathic pain and the accompanying neurochemical alterations without affecting normal pain sensitivity and locomotor activity. WNT signaling activation stimulated production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and TNF-$\alpha$ and regulated the NR2B glutamate receptor and Ca2+-dependent signals through the $\beta$-catenin pathway in the spinal cord. These findings indicate a critical mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and suggest that targeting the WNT signaling pathway may be an effective approach for treating neuropathic pain, including bone cancer pain.},

In humans, 19 WNT proteins have been identified that share 27{\%} to 83{\%} amino-acid sequence identity and a conserved pattern of 23 or 24 cysteine residues. Wnt genes are highly conserved between vertebrate species sharing overall sequence identity and gene structure, and are slightly less conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates.

In adults, Wnts function in homeostasis, and inappropriate activation of the Wnt pathway is implicated in a variety of cancers.},

However, the symptoms are heterogeneous among patients and a number of ASD mouse models have been generated containing mutations that mimic the mutations found in human patients with ASD. Each mouse model was found to display a unique set of repetitive behaviors. In this review, we summarize the repetitive behaviors of the ASD mouse models and variations found in their neural mechanisms including molecular and electrophysiological features. We also propose potential neuronal mechanisms underlying these repetitive behaviors, focusing on the role of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits and brain regions associated with both social and repetitive behaviors. Further understanding of molecular and circuitry mechanisms of the repetitive behaviors associated with ASD is necessary to aid the development of effective treatments for these disorders.},

abstract = {Early during neuromuscular development, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) accumulate at the center of muscle fibers, precisely where motor growth cones navigate and synapses eventually form. Here, we show that Wnt11r binds to the zebrafish unplugged/MuSK ectodomain to organize this central muscle zone. In the absence of such a zone, prepatterned AChRs fail to aggregate and, as visualized by live-cell imaging, growth cones stray from their central path. Using inducible unplugged/MuSK transgenes, we show that organization of the central muscle zone is dispensable for the formation of neural synapses, but essential for AChR prepattern and motor growth cone guidance. Finally, we show that blocking noncanonical dishevelled signaling in muscle fibers disrupts AChR prepatterning and growth cone guidance. We propose that Wnt ligands activate unplugged/MuSK signaling in muscle fibers to restrict growth cone guidance and AChR prepatterns to the muscle center through a mechanism reminiscent of the planar cell polarity pathway. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, we have evaluated the expression of all Wnt ligands, receptors and regulators, and the activation state of Wnt-related signaling pathways in non-activated and differentially activated astroglial cultures. We found that numerous Wnt ligands, receptors and regulators were expressed in non-activated astrocytes, while the Wnt-dependent pathways were constitutively active. Moreover, the expression of most detectable Wnt-related molecules and the activity of the Wnt-dependent pathways suffered post-activation variations which frequently depended on the activation system. Finally, the analysis of the effects exerted by Wnt1 and 5a on the astroglial expression of prototypical genes related to astroglial activation showed that both Wnt ligands increased the astroglial expression of interleukin 1$\beta$ depending on the experimental context, while did not modulate tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$, interleukin 6, transforming growth factor $\beta$1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein expression. These results strongly suggest that the Wnt family of proteins is involved in how astrocytes modulate and respond to the physiological and pathological CNS.},

abstract = {Megf7/Lrp4 is a member of the functionally diverse low-density lipoprotein receptor gene family, a class of ancient and highly conserved cell surface receptors with broad functions in cargo transport and cellular signaling. To gain insight into the as yet unknown biological role of Megf7/Lrp4, we have disrupted the gene in mice. Homozygous Megf7-deficient mice are growth-retarded, with fully penetrant polysyndactyly in their fore and hind limbs, and partially penetrant abnormalities of tooth development. The reason for this developmental abnormality is apparent as early as embryonic day 9.5 when the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), the principal site of Megf7 expression at the distal edge of the embryonic limb bud, forms abnormally in the absence of Megf7. Ectopic expression and aberrant signaling of several molecules involved in limb patterning, including Fgf8, Shh, Bmp2, Bmp4 and Wnt7a, as well as the Wnt- and Bmp-responsive transcription factors Lmx1b and Msx1, result in reduced apoptosis and symmetrical dorsal and ventral expansions of the AER. Abnormal signaling from the AER precedes ectopic chondrocyte condensation and subsequent fusion and duplication of digits in the Megf7 knockouts. Megf7 can antagonize canonical Wnt signaling in vitro. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a role of Megf7 as a modulator of cellular signaling pathways involving Wnts, Bmps, Fgfs and Shh. A similar autosomal recessive defect may also occur in man, where polysyndactyly, in combination with craniofacial abnormalities, is also part of a common genetic syndrome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) has emerged as a good animal model to study the constructive and regressive changes associated with living in cave environments, as both the ancestral sighted morph and the cave dwelling morph are extant. The cave dwelling morphs lack eyes and body pigmentation, but have well developed oral and sensory systems that are essential for survival in dark environments. The cave forms and surface forms are interfertile and give rise to F1 hybrids progeny known as intermediates. In cavefish, degeneration of the lens is one of the key events leading to eye regression. We have previously shown that surgical lens removal in surface fish embryos has an effect on the craniofacial skeleton. Surprisingly, lens removal was also found to have an effect on the caudal teeth in the lower jaw. In order to understand this result, we analyzed the lower jaw and upper jaw dentitions of surface, cavefish and F1 hybrids of surface and cavefish and compared our findings with surface fish that underwent lens removal. We also investigated the upper jaw (premaxillae and maxillae) dentition in these fish.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our tooth analyses shows that cavefish have the highest numbers of teeth in the mandible and maxillae, surface forms have the lowest numbers and F1 hybrids are between these groups. These differences are not observed in the premaxillae. A wide diversity of cuspal morphology can also be found in these fish. Jaw size also differs amongst the groups, with the mandible exhibiting the greatest differences. Interestingly, tooth number in surgery fish is different only in the caudal region of the mandible; this is the region that is constrained in size in all morphs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our data provides the first detailed description of the jaw dentitions of two morphs of Astyanax mexicanus, as well as in F1 hybrids. Tooth number, patterning and cuspal morphology are enhanced in cavefish in all jaws. This is in contrast to the increase in tooth number previously observed on the lens ablated side of the surgery fish. These findings indicate that the mechanisms which govern the constructive traits in cavefish are different to the mechanisms causing an increase tooth number in surgery fish.},

abstract = {Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase regulating diverse cellular functions including metabolism, transcription and cell survival. Numerous intracellular signalling pathways converge on GSK-3 and regulate its activity via inhibitory serine-phosphorylation. Recently, GSK-3 has been involved in learning and memory and in neurodegeneration. Here, we present evidence that implicates GSK-3 in synaptic plasticity. We show that phosphorylation at the inhibitory Ser9 site on GSK-3beta is increased upon induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in both hippocampal subregions CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) in vivo. The increase in inhibitory GSK-3beta phosphorylation is robust and persists for at least one hour postinduction. Furthermore, we find that LTP is impaired in transgenic mice conditionally overexpressing GSK-3beta. The LTP deficits can be attenuated/rescued by chronic treatment with lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor. These results suggest that the inhibition of GSK-3 facilitates the induction of LTP and this might explain some of the negative effects of GSK-3 on learning and memory. It follows that this role of GSK-3beta in LTP might underlie some of the cognitive dysfunction in diseases where GSK-3 dysfunction has been implicated, including Alzheimer's and other dementias.},

abstract = {Development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) requires secretion of specific isoforms of the proteoglycan agrin by motor neurons. Secreted agrin is widely expressed in the basal lamina of various tissues, whereas a transmembrane form is highly expressed in the brain. Expression in the brain is greatest during the period of synaptogenesis, but remains high in regions of the adult brain that show extensive synaptic plasticity. The well-established role of agrin in NMJ development and its presence in the brain elicited investigations of its possible role in synaptogenesis in the brain. Initial studies on the embryonic brain and neuronal cultures of agrin-null mice did not reveal any defects in synaptogenesis. However, subsequent studies in culture demonstrated inhibition of synaptogenesis by agrin antisense oligonucleotides or agrin siRNA. More recently, a substantial loss of excitatory synapses was found in the brains of transgenic adult mice that lacked agrin expression everywhere but in motor neurons. The mechanisms by which agrin influences synapse formation, maintenance and plasticity may include enhancement of excitatory synaptic signaling, activation of the "muscle-specific" receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and positive regulation of dendritic filopodia. In this article I will review the evidence that agrin regulates synapse development, plasticity and signaling in the brain and discuss the evidence for the proposed mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Diverse changes in coloration across distant taxa are mediated through alterations in certain highly conserved pigmentation genes. Among these genes, Mc1r is a frequent target for mutation, and many documented alterations involve coding sequence changes. We investigated whether regulatory mutations in Mc1r may also contribute to pigmentation loss in the blind Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. This species comprises multiple independent cave populations that have evolved reduced (or absent) melanic pigmentation as a consequence of living in darkness for millions of generations. Among the most salient cave-associated traits, complete absence (albinism) or reduced levels of pigmentation (brown) have long been the focus of degenerative pigmentation research in Astyanax. These two Mendelian traits have been linked to specific coding mutations in Oca2 (albinism) and Mc1r (brown). However, four of the seven caves harboring the brown phenotype exhibit unaffected coding sequences compared to surface fish. Thus, diverse genetic changes involving the same genes likely impact reduced pigmentation among cavefish populations. Using both sequence and expression analyses, we show that certain cave-dwelling populations harboring the brown mutation have substantial alterations to the putative Mc1r cis-regulatory region. Several of these sequence mutations in the Mc1r 5' region were present across multiple, independent cave populations. This study suggests that pigmentation reduction in Astyanax cavefish evolves through a combination of both coding and cis-regulatory mutations. Moreover, this study represents one of the first attempts to identify regulatory alterations linked to regressive changes in cave-dwelling populations of A. mexicanus.},

abstract = {Agrin mediates motor neuron-induced differentiation of the postsynaptic apparatus of the neuromuscular junction but its function in brain remains unknown. Here we report that expression of c-fos, induced by activation of nicotinic or glutamatergic receptors, was significantly lower in cortical neurons cultured from agrin-deficient mutant mouse embryos compared to wildtype. Agrin-deficient neurons also exhibited increased resistance to excitotoxic injury. Treatment with recombinant agrin restored glutamate-induced c-fos expression and excitotoxicity of the agrin-deficient neurons to near wild-type levels, confirming the agrin dependence of the phenotype. The observation that c-fos induction by activation of voltage-gated Ca2+channels is also reduced in agrin-deficient neurons raises the possibility that agrin may play a wider role by regulating responses to Ca2+-mediated signals. Consistent with the decline in response of cultured mutant neurons to glutamate, decreases in kainic acid-induced seizure and mortality were observed in adult agrin heterozygous mice. Together, these data demonstrate that agrin plays an important role in defining neuronal responses to excitatory neurotransmitters both in vitro and in vivo.},

abstract = {The neuromuscular junction is the chemical synapse between motor neurons and skeletal muscle fibers. It is designed to reliably convert the action potential from the presynaptic motor neuron into the contraction of the postsynaptic muscle fiber. Diseases that affect the neuromuscular junction may cause failure of this conversion and result in loss of ambulation and respiration. The loss of motor input also causes muscle wasting as muscle mass is constantly adapted to contractile needs by the balancing of protein synthesis and protein degradation. Finally, neuromuscular activity and muscle mass have a major impact on metabolic properties of the organisms. This review discusses the mechanisms involved in the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction, the consequences of and the mechanisms involved in its dysfunction, and its role in maintaining muscle mass during aging. As life expectancy is increasing, loss of muscle mass during aging, called sarcopenia, has emerged as a field of high medical need. Interestingly, aging is also accompanied by structural changes at the neuromuscular junction, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in neuromuscular junction maintenance might be disturbed during aging. In addition, there is now evidence that behavioral paradigms and signaling pathways that are involved in longevity also affect neuromuscular junction stability and sarcopenia.},

Loss of Wnt signaling in developing and adult tissue has been implicated in numerous CNS diseases, but the precise role of Wnt in regulating neuronal survival, and how its absence could lead to disease, is not understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of Wnt activation on neuronal survival in the adult retina, and identified cellular and molecular mediators. Pan-retinal Wnt signaling activation using Wnt3a induced functional and morphological rescue of photoreceptor neurons in the rd10 mouse model of retinal degeneration. Furthermore, Wnt activation using constitutively active $\beta$-catenin specifically targeted to Muller glia increased photoreceptor survival and reduced markers of glial and neuronal remodeling. Wnt-induced photoreceptor protection was associated with elevated levels of the prosurvival protein Stat3, and was reduced by shRNA-mediated knock-down of Stat3, indicating cross-talk between survival pathways. Therefore, these data increase our understanding of the role of Wnt signaling in the retina, and identify radial Muller glia as important cellular mediators of Wnt activity.},

abstract = {One of the master regulators of postsynaptic neuromuscular synaptogenesis is the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). In mammals prominent MuSK expression is believed to be restricted to skeletal muscle. Upon activation by nerve-derived agrin MuSK-dependent signalling participates in both the induction of genes encoding postsynaptic components and aggregation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR) in the subsynaptic muscle membrane. Strikingly, expression of certain isoforms of nerve-derived agrin can also be detected in the CNS. In this study, we examined the expression of MuSK in the brain and eye of rodents. In the retina MuSK was expressed in astrocytes between postnatal days 7 and 14, i.e. at the time when the eyes open. We found that agrin was localized adjacent to MuSK-expressing astrocytes which in turn were detected close to the inner limiting membrane of the rodent retina. In summary, the presence of MuSK on retinal astrocytes suggests a novel role of MuSK signalling pathways in the CNS.},

Accordingly, overexpression of LRP4 in cultured neurons had the opposite effect inducing more but shorter primary dendrites with an increased number of spines. Transsynaptic tracing mediated by rabies virus revealed a reduced number of neurons presynaptic to cortical neurons in which LRP4 was knocked down. Moreover, neuron-specific knock down of LRP4 by in utero electroporation of LRP4 miRNA in vivo also resulted in neurons with fewer primary dendrites and a lower density of spines in the developing cortex and hippocampus. Collectively, our results demonstrate an essential and novel role of neuronal LRP4 in dendritic development and synaptogenesis in the CNS.},

abstract = {Lrp4, the muscle receptor for neuronal Agrin, is expressed in the hippocampus and areas involved in cognition. The function of Lrp4 in the brain, however, is unknown, as Lrp4-/- mice fail to form neuromuscular synapses and die at birth. Lrp4-/- mice, rescued for Lrp4 expression selectively in muscle, survive into adulthood and showed profound deficits in cognitive tasks that assess learning and memory. To learn whether synapses form and function aberrantly, we used electrophysiological and anatomical methods to study hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses. In the absence of Lrp4, the organization of the hippocampus appeared normal, but the frequency of spontaneous release events and spine density on primary apical dendrites were reduced. CA3 input was unable to adequately depolarize CA1 neurons to induce long-term potentiation. Our studies demonstrate a role for Lrp4 in hippocampal function and suggest that patients with mutations in Lrp4 or auto-antibodies to Lrp4 should be evaluated for neurological deficits.},

abstract = {Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) contribute significantly to hippocampal function. Alpha7-nAChRs are present in presynaptic sites in hippocampal neurons and may influence transmitter release, but the factors that determine their presynaptic localization are unknown. We report here that Wnt-7a, a ligand active in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, induces dissociation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein from the beta-catenin cytoplasmic complex and the interaction of APC with alpha7-nAChRs in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, Wnt-7a induces the relocalization of APC to membranes, clustering of APC in neurites, and coclustering of APC with different, presynaptic protein markers. Wnt-7a also increases the number and size of coclusters of alpha7-nAChRs and APC in presynaptic terminals. These short-term changes in alpha7-nAChRs occur in the few minutes after ligand exposure and involve translocation to the plasma membrane without affecting total receptor levels. Longer-term exposure to Wnt-7a increases nAChR alpha7 subunit levels in an APC-independent manner and increases clusters of alpha7-nAChRs in neurites via an APC-dependent process. Together, these results demonstrate that stimulation through the canonical Wnt pathway regulates the presynaptic localization of APC and alpha7-nAChRs with APC serving as an intermediary in the alpha7-nAChR relocalization process. Modulation by Wnt signaling may be essential for alpha7-nAChR expression and function in synapses.},

abstract = {The Wnt family of proteins plays key roles during central nervous system development and has been involved in several neuropathologies during adulthood, including spinal cord injury (SCI). However, Wnts expression knowledge is relatively limited during adult stages. Here, we sought to define the Wnt family expression pattern after SCI in adult mice by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Under physiological conditions, the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of most Wnt ligands, inhibitors, receptors, and coreceptors are constitutively expressed in healthy adult mice. After dorsal hemisection, we found significant time-dependent variations, with a prominent up-regulation of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (Wif1). IHC against Frizzled (Fz) 1 and Fz4, as representatives of late and acute up-regulated receptors, showed a differential expression in the uninjured spinal cord of Fz1 by neurons and oligodendrocytes and Fz4 by astrocytes. After injury, both receptors were maintained in the same type of cells. Finally, by using BATgal reporter mice, our results revealed active $\beta$-catenin signaling in neurons of the dorsal horn and cells of the central canal of uninjured spinal cords, besides a lack of additional SCI-induced activation. In conclusion, we demonstrate Wnt expression in the adult spinal cord of mice that is modulated by SCI, which differs from that previously described in rats. Further, Fz receptors are differentially expressed by neurons and glial cells, suggestive for cell-specific patterns and thus diverse physiological roles. Further studies will help toward in-depth characterization of the role of all Wnt factors and receptors described and eventually allow for the design of novel therapies.},

abstract = {Subterranean biodiversity in Europe is spectacularly rich, with the Western Balkans being home to about 400 cave species, representing the highest number of species per area worldwide [1]. Nonetheless, cave fishes, which are the most commonly found vertebrates in underground habitats [2], have not been described from Europe so far [3]. Here, we report the first European record of a cave fish population, a loach of the genus Barbatula (Figure 1), found in the Danube-Aach system, an underground karst water system in Southern Germany [4]. The fish exhibit traits typically observed in organisms adapted to subterranean life including reduced eyes and pale body coloration [5]. The newly discovered population also represents globally the northernmost cave fish found so far. The geological history of the region implies that the Danube-Aach system was colonized post-glacially. A recent origin of the cave fish is supported by genetic analyses, because the subterranean population shares COI gene haplotypes with adjacent surface stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) populations (Figure 1D). Nonetheless, population genetic analyses based on microsatellites indicated that cave fish are genetically isolated from populations in surface habitats (Figure 1E) and exhibit reduced genetic variability. Hence, the newly discovered European cave loaches do not represent individuals displaced from surface populations, but they follow a unique evolutionary trajectory towards cave life.},

abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may arise from increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Many pharmacological treatments have been tested in ASD, but only limited success has been achieved. Here we report that BTBR T+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of idiopathic autism, have reduced spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission. Treatment with low nonsedating/nonanxiolytic doses of benzodiazepines, which increase inhibitory neurotransmission through positive allosteric modulation of postsynaptic GABAAreceptors, improved deficits in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and spatial learning. Moreover, negative allosteric modulation of GABAAreceptors impaired social behavior in C57BL/6J and 129SvJ wild-type mice, suggesting that reduced inhibitory neurotransmission may contribute to social and cognitive deficits. The dramatic behavioral improvement after low-dose benzodiazepine treatment was subunit specific-the $\alpha$2,3-subunit-selective positive allosteric modulator L-838,417 was effective, but the $\alpha$1-subunit-selective drug zolpidem exacerbated social deficits. Impaired GABAergic neurotransmission may contribute to ASD, and $\alpha$2,3-subunit-selective positive GABAAreceptor modulation may be an effective treatment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Anteroposterior patterning of the vertebrate forebrain during gastrulation involves graded Wnt signaling, which segregates anterior fields (telencephalon and eye) from the diencephalon. How the telencephalic and retinal primordia are subsequently subdivided remains largely unknown. We demonstrate that at late gastrulation the Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor Rx3 biases cell specification choices towards the retinal fate within a population of bipotential precursors of the anterior forebrain: direct cell tracing demonstrates that retinal precursors acquire a telencephalic fate in embryos homozygous for the rx3-null allele ckh(ne2611), characterized by an enlarged telencephalon and a lack of eyes. Chimera analyses further indicate that this function of Rx3 is cell autonomous. Transfating of the eye field in the absence of Rx3 function correlates with a substantial posterior expansion of expression of the Wnt antagonist Tlc and the winged-helix transcription factor Foxg1. These results suggest that the process segregating the telencephalic and eye fields is isolated from diencephalic patterning, and is mediated by Rx3.},

MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is expressed in skeletal muscle, and Agrin, a motor neuron-derived ligand that stimulates MuSK phosphorylation, play critical roles in synaptic differentiation, as synapses do not form in their absence, and mutations in MuSK or downstream effectors are a major cause of a group of neuromuscular disorders, termed congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). How Agrin activates MuSK and stimulates synaptic differentiation is not known and remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of signaling at neuromuscular synapses.

abstract = {During vertebrate development, the initial wave of hematopoiesis produces cells that help to shape the developing circulatory system and oxygenate the early embryo. The differentiation of primitive erythroid and myeloid cells occurs within a short transitory period, and is subject to precise molecular regulation by a hierarchical cascade of transcription factors. The TALE-class homeodomain transcription factors Meis and Pbx function to regulate embryonic hematopoiesis, but it is not known where Meis and Pbx proteins participate in the hematopoietic transcription factor cascade. To address these questions, we have ablated Meis1 and Pbx proteins in zebrafish, and characterized their molecular effects on known markers of primitive hematopoiesis. Embryos lacking Meis1 and Pbx exhibit a severe reduction in the expression of gata1, the earliest marker of erythroid cell fate, and fail to produce visible circulating blood cells. Concomitant with a loss of gata1, Meis1- and Pbx-depleted embryos exhibit downregulated embryonic hemoglobin (hbae3) expression, and possess increased numbers of pu.1-positive myeloid cells. gata1-overexpression rescues hbae3 expression in Pbx-depleted; meis1-morphant embryos, placing Pbx and Meis1 upstream of gata1 in the erythropoietic transcription factor hierarchy. Our study conclusively demonstrates that Meis1 and Pbx act to specify the erythropoietic cell lineage and inhibit myelopoiesis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Understanding the developmental steps that shape formation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) connecting motoneurons to skeletal muscle fibers is crucial. Wnt morphogens are key players in the formation of this specialized peripheral synapse, but their individual and collaborative functions and downstream pathways remain poorly understood at the NMJ. Here, we demonstrate through Wnt4 and Wnt11 gain-of-function studies in cell culture or in mice that Wnts enhance acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering and motor axon outgrowth. By contrast, loss of Wnt11 or Wnt-dependent signaling in vivo decreases AChR clustering and motor nerve terminal branching. Both Wnt4 and Wnt11 stimulate AChR mRNA levels and AChR clustering downstream of activation of the $\beta$-catenin pathway. Strikingly, Wnt4 and Wnt11 co-immunoprecipitate with Vangl2, a core component of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which accumulates at embryonic NMJs. Moreover, mice bearing a Vangl2 loss-of-function mutation (loop-tail) exhibit fewer AChR clusters and overgrowth of motor axons bypassing AChR clusters. Together, our results provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Wnt4 and Wnt11 cooperatively contribute to mammalian NMJ formation through activation of both the canonical and Vangl2-dependent core PCP pathways.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The extraocular muscles (EOM) and their motor neurons are spared in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In limb muscle, axon retraction from the neuromuscular junctions occurs early in the disease. Wnts, a conserved family of secreted signaling molecules, play a critical role in neuromuscular junction formation. This is the first study to examine Wnt signaling for its potential involvement in maintenance of normal morphology in EOM in ALS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Extraocular muscle and limb muscle axons, neuromuscular junctions, and myofibers from control, aging, and ALS subjects and the SOD1(G93A) mouse model of ALS were quantified for their expression of Wnt1, Wnt3a, Wnt5a, Wnt7a, and $\beta$-catenin.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All four Wnt isoforms were expressed in most axon profiles in all human EOM. Significantly fewer were positive for Wnt1, Wnt3a, and Wnt7a in the human limb muscles. Similar differential patterns in Wnt myofiber expression were also seen except in the case of Wnt7a, where expression was elevated. In the SOD1(G93A) mouse, all four Wnt isoforms were significantly decreased in the neuromuscular junctions at the terminal stage compared to values in age-matched controls. $\beta$-Catenin was activated in a subset of myofibers in EOM and limb muscle in all subjects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The differences in expression of Wnts in EOM and limb muscle, particularly at the neuromuscular junction level, suggest that they play a role in the pathophysiology of ALS. Collectively, the data support a role for signaling of Wnts in the preservation of the EOM in ALS and their dysregulation and the subsequent development of pathology in the ALS limb muscles.},

LRP4 protein interacted with postsynaptic scaffold proteins such as postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 via its C-terminal tail sequence, and associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor subunit. The mRNA of LRP4 was localized to dendrites, as well as somas, of neuronal cells, and the full-length protein of 250 kDa was highly concentrated in the brain and localized to various subcellular compartments in the brain, including synaptic fractions. Immunocytochemical study using cultured cortical neurons suggested surface localization in the neuronal cells both in somas and dendrites. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylated the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of LRP4 at Ser1887 and Ser1900, and the phosphorylation at the latter site suppressed the interaction of the protein with PSD-95 and synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97). These findings suggest a postsynaptic role for LRP4, a putative endocytic multiligand receptor, and a mechanism in which CaMKII regulates PDZ-dependent protein-protein interactions and receptor dynamics.},

These colonizations likely occurred ∼1-5 MYa. Despite evidence of historical and contemporary gene flow between cave and surface forms, the cave-associated phenotype appears to remain quite stable in nature. This model system has provided insight to the mechanisms of phenotypic regression, the genetic basis for constructive trait evolution, and the origin of behavioral novelties.

We have recently demonstrated that Wnt signaling, which is important in developmental processes of the nervous systems, plays critical roles in the development of neuropathic pain through the $\beta$-catenin-dependent pathway in the spinal cord and the $\beta$-catenin-independent pathway in primary sensory neurons after nerve injury. Here, we report that Wnt signaling may contribute to neuropathic pain through the atypical Wnt/Ryk signaling pathway in rats. Sciatic nerve injury causes a rapid-onset and long-lasting expression of Wnt3a, Wnt5b, and Ryk receptors in primary sensory neurons, and dorsal horn neurons and astrocytes. Spinal blocking of the Wnt/Ryk receptor signaling inhibits the induction and persistence of neuropathic pain without affecting normal pain sensitivity and locomotor activity. Blocking activation of the Ryk receptor with anti-Ryk antibody, in vivo or in vitro, greatly suppresses nerve injury-induced increased intracellular Ca and hyperexcitability of the sensory neurons, and also the enhanced plasticity of synapses between afferent C-fibers and the dorsal horn neurons, and activation of the NR2B receptor and the subsequent Ca-dependent signals CaMKII, Src, ERK, PKC$\gamma$, and CREB in sensory neurons and the spinal cord. These findings indicate a critical mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and suggest that targeting the Wnt/Ryk signaling may be an effective approach for treating neuropathic pain.},

We also show that Evi acts cell-autonomously in the postsynaptic Wnt-receiving cell to target dGRIP, a Wg-receptor-interacting protein, to postsynaptic sites. Upon Evi loss of function, dGRIP is not properly targeted to synaptic sites, interfering with postsynaptic Wnt signal transduction. These findings uncover a previously unknown cellular mechanism by which a secreted Wnt is transported across synapses by Evi-containing vesicles and reveal trafficking functions of Evi in both the Wnt-producing and the Wnt-receiving cells.

abstract = {In adult hippocampus, new neurons are continuously generated from neural stem cells (NSCs), but the molecular mechanisms regulating adult neurogenesis remain elusive. We found that Wnt signaling, together with the removal of Sox2, triggered the expression of NeuroD1 in mice. This transcriptional regulatory mechanism was dependent on a DNA element containing overlapping Sox2 and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF)-binding sites (Sox/LEF) in the promoter. Notably, Sox/LEF sites were also found in long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) elements, consistent with their critical roles in the transition of NSCs to proliferating neuronal progenitors. Our results describe a previously unknown Wnt-mediated regulatory mechanism that simultaneously coordinates activation of NeuroD1 and LINE-1, which is important for adult neurogenesis and survival of neuronal progenitors. Moreover, the discovery that LINE-1 retro-elements embedded in the mammalian genome can function as bi-directional promoters suggests that Sox/LEF regulatory sites may represent a general mechanism, at least in part, for relaying environmental signals to other nearby loci to promote adult hippocampal neurogenesis.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the expression pattern of Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunit isoforms within the rodent and primate central nervous system. Membrane fractions prepared from rat cerebral cortical type-1 astrocytes and rat cerebellar granule and hippocampal neurons were characterized by immunoblot analyses using a panel of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunit isoform-specific antisera. Each cell type was found to express the $\alpha$1 isoform but showed differences in the expression of other subunits. Cortical astrocytes displayed $\alpha$2 and $\beta$2 subunits, whereas cerebellar granule neurons showed expression of $\alpha$3 and $\beta$1 subunits. All three $\alpha$ subunit isotypes were detected in hippocampal neurons. A survey of the immunofluorescent staining pattern of the $\alpha$3 subunit in rat and monkey brain confirmed that expression of this Na,K-ATPase $\alpha$ subunit isoform was restricted exclusively to neurons. These results suggest that both neurons and astrocytes express multiple, yet distinct, Na,K-ATPase isoenzymes. The identification of cell types expressing limited combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits should provide a framework for understanding the physiological significance of Na,K-ATPase isoenzyme diversity and may provide useful tools for the analysis of cell lineage in the mammalian central nervous system. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Ohno2017,
abstract = {We humans have evolved by acquiring diversity of alternative RNA metabolisms including alternative means of splicing and transcribing non-coding genes, and not by acquiring new coding genes. Tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific alternative RNA splicing is achieved by tightly regulated spatiotemporal regulation of expressions and activations of RNA-binding proteins that recognize their cognate splicing cis-elements on nascent RNA transcripts. Genes expressed at the neuromuscular junction are also alternatively spliced. In addition, germline mutations provoke aberrant splicing by compromising binding of RNA-binding proteins, and cause congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). We present physiological splicing mechanisms of genes for agrin (AGRN), acetylcholinesterase (ACHE), MuSK (MUSK), acetylcholine receptor (AChR) $\alpha$1 subunit (CHRNA1), and collagen Q (COLQ) in human, and their aberration in diseases. Splicing isoforms of AChET , AChEH , and AChER are generated by hnRNP H/F. Skipping of MUSK exon 10 makes a Wnt-insensitive MuSK isoform, which is unique to human. Skipping of exon 10 is achieved by coordinated binding of hnRNP C, YB-1, and hnRNP L to exon 10. Exon P3A of CHRNA1 is alternatively included to generate a non-functional AChR $\alpha$1 subunit in human. Molecular dissection of splicing mutations in patients with CMS reveals that exon P3A is alternatively skipped by hnRNP H, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1, and hnRNP L. Similarly, analysis of an exonic mutation in COLQ exon 16 in a CMS patient discloses that constitutive splicing of exon 16 requires binding of serine arginine-rich splicing factor 1. Intronic and exonic splicing mutations in CMS enable us to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying alternative and constitutive splicing of genes expressed at the neuromuscular junction.

abstract = {Within the species Astyanax mexicanus, there are several inter-fertile populations of river-dwelling sighted fish and cave-dwelling blind fish which have evolved morphological and behavioral adaptations. We have recently reported a developmental and neurophysiological basis for the loss of aggressive behavior in the blind cavefish morph of Astyanax. Using an appropriate behavioral assay, we have shown that surface Astyanax show intense dominance-related aggressiveness. The expression of this behavior is inversely correlated with the serotonin (5HT) levels in their hindbrain raphe nucleus. Moreover this behavior is not solely visually-evoked and has a genetic component. Conversely in cavefish, there is no raphe-driven dominance aggressiveness. Instead, the embryonic Sonic Hedgehog-dependent modification of the size of a serotonergic neuronal group localized in their hypothalamus causes a shift in their behavioral pattern: instead of fighting, they search for food. Here we further discuss the origin and nature of this behavioral shift.},

Previous studies have shown that sensory systems such as the lateral line (mechanosensory) and taste buds (chemosensory) are modified in cavefish. It has long been hypothesized that another chemosensory modality, the olfactory system, might have evolved as well to provide an additional mechanism for food-searching in troglomorphic Astyanax populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFINDINGS:During a March 2013 cave expedition to the Sierra de El Abra region of San Lu{\'{i}}s Potosi, Mexico, we tested chemosensory capabilities of the Astyanax mexicanus of the Rio Subterr{\'{a}}neo cave. This cave hosts a hybrid population presenting a wide range of troglomorphic and epigean mixed phenotypes. During a behavioral test performed in situ in the cave, a striking correlation was observed between the absence of eyes and an increased attraction to food extract. In addition, eyeless troglomorphic fish possessed significantly larger naris size than their eyed, nontroglomorphic counterparts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:Our findings suggest that chemosensory capabilities might have evolved in cave-dwelling Astyanax mexicanus and that modulation of naris size might at least partially underlie this likely adaptive change.},

abstract = {A central problem in neurobiology is the elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie left–right asymmetries in brain structure and function. Using a transcriptome screening approach, we found asymmetric gene expression patterns in the right when compared with the left hippocampal formation at postnatal days (P) 6, 9, and 60 in the rat. Of those genes that were differentially expressed, most were predominantly expressed in the right hippocampus at P6, whereas most were predominantly expressed in the left at P9 and P60. Real-time PCR analysis of genes associated with synaptic vesicle trafficking confirmed this pattern. At P6, 9 of 13 such genes were more robustly expressed in the right hippocampus, while only 1 gene was predominantly expressed in the left. Conversely, at P9, 5 of the 13 genes were more highly expressed in the left hippocampus and only 1 gene was predominantly expressed in the right. This pattern persisted at P60: eight genes were more robustly expressed in the left hippocampus, and the remaining five showed no hemispheric preference. These data demonstrate a pattern of early lateralized gene expression that is likely to underlie the establishment of functional asymmetry in the adult hippocampus.},

Recent research suggests that the OB is also a source of NSCs that remains largely unexplored. Using single/dual-labeling procedures, we address the existence of NSCs in the innermost layers of the OB. In vivo, these cells are more quiescent that their SVZ counterparts, but after in vitro expansion, they behave similarly. Self-renewal and proliferation assays in co-culture with niche astrocytes indicate that OB-glia restricts NSC activity whereas SVZ-glia has the opposite effect. Gene expression profiling identifies WNT7A as a key SVZ-glial factor lacking in OB-glia that enhances self-renewal, thereby improving the propagation of OB-NSC cultures. These data demonstrate that region-specific glial factors account for in vivo differences in NSC activity and point to WNT7A as a tool that may be instrumental for the NSC expansion phase that precedes grafting.},
